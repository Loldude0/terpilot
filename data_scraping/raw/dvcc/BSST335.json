{"course_name": "Innovations in Countering Violent Extremism", "course_number": "BSST335", "credits": "3", "grading_method": "Reg, P-F, Aud,", "description": "Introduces students to novel innovations in the development of Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) programs. CVE is a realm of policy, programs, and interventions designed to prevent individuals from engaging in violence associated with radical political, social, cultural, and/or religious ideologies. Unlike counterterrorism strategies that often focus on targeting and disrupting terrorist plots, CVE focuses on radicalization prevention through engagement and intervention with communities. CVE also focuses on deradicalization and rehabilitation of former extremists. Throughout the course, students will work in groups to develop their own innovative CVE programs, rather than merely learn about CVE through lectures.", "geneds": ["DVCC"], "sections": [{"section_id": "0101", "professor": "Amy Pate", "total_seats": "40", "open_seats": "21", "waitlist": "0", "times": "TuTh 3:30pm-4:45pm"}]}
