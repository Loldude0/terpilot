Type \"Language Science News\" into your Google search bar. Among the more than 3 billion hits, headlines like \"What is love? It depends what language you speak\" and \"Science's English dominance hinders diversity\" invite you to think about the impact of words on thought and behavior. These are stories about how humans acquire and use language, but they ultimately address big questions about how we experience knowledge itself. In a world of unprecedented access to science journalism, did you ever read a headline about human behavior and wonder: How do we know? This class takes up the elegant ways cognitive scientists design experiments to answer crucial questions about language and thought, brain and behavior, that have no intuitive answers. Students will dive deep into the media coverage of their favorite claims about what we know, debate the psychological science behind these claims, and develop transferable critical-thinking skills in the process.", "geneds": ["DSHS", "SCIS"], "sections": [{"section_id": "0101", "professor": "Jared Novick", "total_seats": "9", "open_seats": "2", "waitlist": "0", "times": "TuTh 11:00am-12:15pm"}, {"section_id": "FC02", "professor": "Meghan Hersh", "total_seats": "22", "open_seats": "22", "waitlist": "0", "times": "TuTh 4:30pm-5:45pm"}]}
