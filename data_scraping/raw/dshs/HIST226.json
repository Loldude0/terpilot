By exploring the writings of major figures as well as the preferences of anonymous voters--and everyone in between, this course will help students identify the overarching themes and the important forgotten moments in our nation's political development. Students will end the semester armed with a mastery of this history, an understanding of the methods of political historians and scholars in related fields, and a contextualization of our contemporary political world.", "geneds": ["DSHS"], "sections": [{"section_id": "0101", "professor": "Robert Chiles", "total_seats": "40", "open_seats": "15", "waitlist": "0", "times": "TuTh 11:00am-12:15pm"}]}
