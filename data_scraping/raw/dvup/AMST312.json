{"course_name": "Introduction to Native American and Indigenous Studies", "course_number": "AMST312", "credits": "3", "grading_method": "Reg, P-F,", "description": "Key concepts and theories in Native American Studies beginning with an overview of the field and some of its foundational readings and history, then will move into an understanding of Native American identity and representation and a discussion of Indigenous sovereignty and self-determination. The course will outline past and present genocidal practices that seek to eliminate Native people and Indigenous responses to those structures such as the concept of survivance, Native feminisms, and theories of Indigenous resurgence. The course seeks to move students through an understanding of past and present structures affecting Native American people in the United States and Canada and move into readings that highlight Native articulations of present and future agency. While the focus of the course is Native peoples with the United States and Canada, understanding Indigenous histories and concepts always includes a hemispheric and transnational analysis.", "geneds": ["DVUP", "DSHS"], "sections": [{"section_id": "0101", "professor": "Lydia Curliss", "total_seats": "25", "open_seats": "18", "waitlist": "0", "times": "TuTh 2:00pm-3:15pm"}]}
