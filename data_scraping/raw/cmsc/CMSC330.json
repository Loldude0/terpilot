Several different models of languages are discussed, including dynamic, scripting (e.g., Ruby, Python) functional (e.g., OCaml, Haskell, Scheme), and memory safe systems programming (e.g., Rust). Explores language features such as formal syntax, scoping and binding of variables, higher-order programming, typing, and type polymorphism. Introduces finite automata, context free grammar, parsing, lambda calculus, and basics of security attacks and software security.", "sections": [{"section_id": "0101", "professor": "Cliff Bakalian", "total_seats": "36", "open_seats": "6", "waitlist": "0", "times": "TuTh 12:30pm-1:45pm | F 9:00am-9:50am"}, {"section_id": "0102", "professor": "Cliff Bakalian", "total_seats": "36", "open_seats": "10", "waitlist": "0", "times": "TuTh 12:30pm-1:45pm | F 10:00am-10:50am"}, {"section_id": "0103", "professor": "Cliff Bakalian", "total_seats": "36", "open_seats": "19", "waitlist": "0", "times": "TuTh 12:30pm-1:45pm | F 11:00am-11:50am"}, {"section_id": "0104", "professor": "Cliff Bakalian", "total_seats": "36", "open_seats": "9", "waitlist": "0", "times": "TuTh 12:30pm-1:45pm | F 12:00pm-12:50pm"}, {"section_id": "0105", "professor": "Cliff Bakalian", "total_seats": "36", "open_seats": "27", "waitlist": "0", "times": "TuTh 12:30pm-1:45pm | F 1:00pm-1:50pm"}, {"section_id": "0107", "professor": "Cliff Bakalian", "total_seats": "36", "open_seats": "27", "waitlist": "0", "times": "TuTh 12:30pm-1:45pm | F 2:00pm-2:50pm"}, {"section_id": "0108", "professor": "Cliff Bakalian", "total_seats": "36", "open_seats": "35", "waitlist": "0", "times": "TuTh 12:30pm-1:45pm | F 3:00pm-3:50pm"}, {"section_id": "0201", "professor": "Cliff Bakalian", "total_seats": "36", "open_seats": "20", "waitlist": "0", "times": "TuTh 2:00pm-3:15pm | F 9:00am-9:50am"}, {"section_id": "0202", "professor": "Cliff Bakalian", "total_seats": "36", "open_seats": "31", "waitlist": "0", "times": "TuTh 2:00pm-3:15pm | F 10:00am-10:50am"}, {"section_id": "0203", "professor": "Cliff Bakalian", "total_seats": "36", "open_seats": "31", "waitlist": "0", "times": "TuTh 2:00pm-3:15pm | F 10:00am-10:50am"}, {"section_id": "0204", "professor": "Cliff Bakalian", "total_seats": "36", "open_seats": "23", "waitlist": "0", "times": "TuTh 2:00pm-3:15pm | F 11:00am-11:50am"}, {"section_id": "0205", "professor": "Cliff Bakalian", "total_seats": "36", "open_seats": "23", "waitlist": "0", "times": "TuTh 2:00pm-3:15pm | F 12:00pm-12:50pm"}, {"section_id": "0206", "professor": "Cliff Bakalian", "total_seats": "36", "open_seats": "28", "waitlist": "0", "times": "TuTh 2:00pm-3:15pm | F 1:00pm-1:50pm"}, {"section_id": "0207", "professor": "Cliff Bakalian", "total_seats": "36", "open_seats": "25", "waitlist": "0", "times": "TuTh 2:00pm-3:15pm | F 2:00pm-2:50pm"}, {"section_id": "0301", "professor": "Anwar Mamat", "total_seats": "35", "open_seats": "0", "waitlist": "0", "times": "MW 2:00pm-3:15pm | F 11:00am-11:50am"}, {"section_id": "0302", "professor": "Anwar Mamat", "total_seats": "35", "open_seats": "0", "waitlist": "0", "times": "MW 2:00pm-3:15pm | F 12:00pm-12:50pm"}, {"section_id": "0303", "professor": "Anwar Mamat", "total_seats": "35", "open_seats": "6", "waitlist": "0", "times": "MW 2:00pm-3:15pm | F 12:00pm-12:50pm"}, {"section_id": "0304", "professor": "Anwar Mamat", "total_seats": "35", "open_seats": "8", "waitlist": "0", "times": "MW 2:00pm-3:15pm | F 1:00pm-1:50pm"}, {"section_id": "0305", "professor": "Anwar Mamat", "total_seats": "35", "open_seats": "29", "waitlist": "0", "times": "MW 2:00pm-3:15pm | F 1:00pm-1:50pm"}]}
