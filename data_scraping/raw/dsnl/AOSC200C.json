Most people think they know but if you ask people to explain the differences and similarities you're bound to get a range of answers. Weather affects not just our daily activities but other important aspects of society such as transportation, commerce, security and agriculture. Most people understand what weather is to some extent. Climate and climate change are concepts that evoke strong emotional responses from people but are less well understood. In this class, students examine fundamental issues such as the greenhouse effect, severe weather, and global weather patterns and how they relate to a changing climate. Instruction in the lectures will provide the basic knowledge needed to understand these issues. In the discussion sections, students will be divided into groups to address the implications of these topics through group projects.", "geneds": ["DSNL                                    (if taken with AOSC201)", "DSNS", "SCIS"], "sections": [{"section_id": "0104", "professor": "Timothy Canty", "total_seats": "30", "open_seats": "30", "waitlist": "0", "times": "TuTh 12:30pm-1:45pm | W 9:00am-9:50am"}]}
