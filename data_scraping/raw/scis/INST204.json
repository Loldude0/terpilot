These values create differential outcomes for the different people enmeshed in these systems, but both these values and these systems can be changed to support different values and different outcomes. The class serves as an introduction to the emerging field of algorithmic bias that bridges the disciplines of information science, computer science, law, policy, philosophy, sociology, urban planning, and others.", "geneds": ["SCIS", "DSHS"], "sections": [{"section_id": "0101", "professor": "Instructor: TBA", "total_seats": "22", "open_seats": "11", "waitlist": "0", "times": "TuTh 2:00pm-3:15pm"}, {"section_id": "0101", "professor": "Instructor: TBA", "total_seats": "22", "open_seats": "22", "waitlist": "0", "times": "TuTh 9:30am-10:45am"}]}
