{"course_name": "Globalizing the American Revolution", "course_number": "HNUH218C", "credits": "3", "grading_method": "Reg,", "description": "How is the American Revolution a creation story in the making of our multi-cultural and interconnected modern world? Consider the Declaration of Independence. When first published on July 5, 1776, it was printed by an immigrant Irishman on Dutch paper that had been brought over from England. This was the first such declaration of independence ever issued, but its ideas and forms traveled far and wide. More than 100 other declarations of independence have been issued since then. The people that declaration mobilized are similarly diverse: the American Revolution is as much the story of Creek farmers, Spanish soldiers, French slaves, Canadian fugitives, Indian tea-growers, and African statesmen as it is of the Minutemen and Sons of Liberty. In this globe-trotting class, students will be positioned to debate how the familiar story of the American Revolution changes when we place it in transnational context.", "geneds": ["SCIS", "DSHS"], "sections": [{"section_id": "0101", "professor": "Richard Bell", "total_seats": "10", "open_seats": "7", "waitlist": "0", "times": "MW 10:00am-10:50am | F 10:00am-10:50am"}, {"section_id": "0102", "professor": "Richard Bell", "total_seats": "10", "open_seats": "10", "waitlist": "0", "times": "MW 10:00am-10:50am | F 11:00am-11:50am"}, {"section_id": "0103", "professor": "Richard Bell", "total_seats": "10", "open_seats": "10", "waitlist": "0", "times": "MW 10:00am-10:50am | F 12:00pm-12:50pm"}]}
