{"course_name": "Art Activism in Iran", "course_number": "PERS280", "credits": "3", "grading_method": "Reg, P-F, Aud,", "description": "Explores Iranian artists' intent and hope for change and their critical and playful strategies of making a difference through their visual or performing arts created since 1980. While exploring key concepts, contexts, and debates by examining a variety of artworks, we explore diverse and unique transgressive stories, strategies, and styles that these works present to address themes of social justice through the art. We examine how multimedia art forms (dance, theatre, cinema, painting, digital art, and music) empower Iranian artists to practice their identity and exercise their agency as these aspects intersect with race, ethnicity, class, sexuality, ability, and education in a shifting and multilayered context.", "geneds": ["DSHU"]}
