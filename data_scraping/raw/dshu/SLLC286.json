{"course_name": "Living the Good Life: Chinese Philosophy in the Modern World", "course_number": "SLLC286", "credits": "3", "grading_method": "Reg, P-F, Aud,", "description": "Confucius, Mencius, Zhuangzi and other Chinese thinkers who lived more than 2,000 years ago would argue that the contemporary Western emphasis on self-discovery (Find yourself) and self-acceptance has led you astray. See what they have to say and discuss what relevance it has for the modern world as we study how early Chinese thinkers wrestled with questions of existence, morality, and governance. No previous knowledge of Chinese philosophy and history will be assumed and no prerequisites are required. We will discuss ideas that are both historical and relevant to students' lives. What is \"the Way\"? How do we cultivate spontaneity? Is there a stable self? How can we be more alive? These are questions important for ancient kings but also for UMD students choosing a major, or wondering how ARHU can benefit them.", "geneds": ["DSHU", "SCIS"], "sections": [{"section_id": "0101", "professor": "Andrew Schonebaum", "total_seats": "60", "open_seats": "17", "waitlist": "0", "times": "TuTh 2:00pm-3:15pm"}]}
