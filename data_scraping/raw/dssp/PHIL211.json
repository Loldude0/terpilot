{"course_name": "AI & ETHICS", "course_number": "PHIL211", "credits": "3", "grading_method": "Reg, P-F, Aud,", "description": "An introduction to a major subfield of contemporary Philosophy, namely applied ethics, and the experience of using some major tools in the practice of philosophy more generally, namely, the construction and formal evaluation of arguments, conceptual analysis, the use of thought experiments, and clear, direct and persuasive writing. Learning how to execute the latter will involve an intense iterative process. The substantive focus of the course will be the ethical evaluation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in some of its current and potentially future incarnations. We'll examine algorithmic opacity, algorithmic bias and decision-making, autonomous weapons systems, human-robot interaction, and artificial moral agents, in order to uncover what, if any, ethical issues they give rise to.", "geneds": ["DSSP"], "sections": [{"section_id": "0101", "professor": "Susan Dwyer", "total_seats": "20", "open_seats": "15", "waitlist": "0", "times": "TuTh 2:00pm-3:15pm | F 10:00am-10:50am"}, {"section_id": "0102", "professor": "Susan Dwyer", "total_seats": "20", "open_seats": "14", "waitlist": "0", "times": "TuTh 2:00pm-3:15pm | F 11:00am-11:50am"}, {"section_id": "0103", "professor": "Susan Dwyer", "total_seats": "20", "open_seats": "12", "waitlist": "0", "times": "TuTh 2:00pm-3:15pm | F 1:00pm-1:50pm"}]}
