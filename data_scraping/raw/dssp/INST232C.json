In this course, we explore health justice - the conviction and enactment of the idea that every person is morally entitled to a fair and sufficient capability to be healthy. We especially focus on the ways in which information-related factors, such as people's access to health information, their strategies for seeking (or avoiding) health information, and their health and digital health literacy, contribute to health (in)justice. Our goal in this class is to promote health justice for all by identifying information-related solutions that will help to facilitate people's access to health information and improve their abilities to find, assess, and make use of information to optimize their own and others' health.", "geneds": ["SCIS", "DSHS", "DSSP"], "sections": [{"section_id": "0101", "professor": "Beth St Jean", "total_seats": "45", "open_seats": "45", "waitlist": "0", "times": "TuTh 9:30am-10:45am"}]}
