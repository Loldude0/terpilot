{"course_name": "Introduction to the Blue Ocean", "course_number": "AOSC375", "credits": "3", "grading_method": "Reg, P-F, Aud,", "prereq": "", "description": "The global ocean is a major component of the Earth System that shapes life on earth, including our weather and climate. We explore the observation-based interdisciplinary science of oceanography, identifying its strong connections to related sciences like meteorology, and geography. We apply this developing understanding to environmental issues such as marine pollution, fish and fisheries, as well as to climate variability and to the changes to the marine environment that are resulting from steadily rising levels of atmospheric greenhouse gasses. Focusses include the biogeochemical and physical changes we can observe in the nearby Chesapeake Bay and the coastal waters of Eastern Shore, Maryland.", "geneds": ["DSNS"], "sections": [{"section_id": "0101", "professor": "James Carton", "total_seats": "60", "open_seats": "43", "waitlist": "0", "times": "MWF 11:00am-11:50am"}]}
