{"course_name": "Contemporary Chinese Art and Film", "course_number": "ARTH392", "credits": "3", "grading_method": "Reg, P-F, Aud,", "description": "Contemporary Chinese art and film are arguably the most vibrant of all national arts at the turn of the millennium and have become the face - both figuratively and literally - of contemporary China, a complex society with historic overlays of Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, Communism, Post-socialism, and state capitalism. Students will consider a wide range of art forms (painting, photography, video, installation, web-based media, and film) in four broad themes (uses of the past; critiques of power; representations of race, gender, and sexuality; socially engaged art) and explore the complex intertwining of the political, historical, and aesthetic aspects in Chinese contemporary art and film, as well as the multiple contexts in which these artworks are created and circulated.", "geneds": ["DSHU"], "sections": [{"section_id": "0101", "professor": "Jason Kuo", "total_seats": "25", "open_seats": "0", "waitlist": "1", "times": "M 1:00pm-3:30pm"}]}
