{"course_name": "Beyond Race: Human Biological Diversity", "course_number": "BSCI151", "credits": "3", "grading_method": "Reg, P-F, Aud,", "description": "Do racial labels have any practical use in understanding human biological diversity? Such categorizations are inextricably linked to racism, including a history of misuse in science going back hundreds of years, yet modern biological research and medicine often include the use of race. At its core, addressing this question requires understanding the balance between genetic and non-genetic factors underlying human diversity. The course will help students make an informed critique of the biological basis of race through the study of topics such as: basic biology, data analysis and experimental design, human evolution and genetics, and biomedical research and health outcomes.", "geneds": ["SCIS", "DVUP", "DSNS", "DSSP"], "sections": [{"section_id": "0101", "professor": "Kimberly Paczolt", "total_seats": "36", "open_seats": "22", "waitlist": "0", "times": "MWF 3:00pm-3:50pm"}]}
