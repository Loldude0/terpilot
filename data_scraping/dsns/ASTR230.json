Has it ever crossed your mind how lucky you are that you live on a water-rich planet with an oxygen-rich atmosphere? Have you ever suspected novelists and scriptwriters of creating ridiculous planets that violate scientific laws? Does the fate of our planet's thin biosphere keep you up at night? How common is life in the Universe? These are difficult questions, but armed with the right information, you can answer all of them. The Science and Fiction of Planetary Systems will help you develop a deeper understanding of why planets are the way they are. Along the way, you'll see examples of mistakes made in classic science fiction movies, novels and short stories and get the chance to invent your own plausible planets!", "geneds": ["SCIS", "DSNS"], "sections": [{"section_id": "0101", "professor": "Marvin Jones", "total_seats": "10", "open_seats": "1", "waitlist": "0", "times": "W 9:00am-9:50am | MWF 12:00pm-12:50pm"}, {"section_id": "0102", "professor": "Marvin Jones", "total_seats": "10", "open_seats": "3", "waitlist": "0", "times": "W 9:00am-9:50am | MWF 1:00pm-1:50pm"}]}
