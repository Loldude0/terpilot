Right here is a teacher who really seems like they care about the subject can teach it in a way thats easy to understand and seems to care for the students as well. He's personable, funny, and I am probably more engaged in his lectures than I am in any other CS lecture I've had before. One thing I love is that he'll always answer questions and is happy to do so. He's got funny little nerdy references in his slides as well which is nice coming from Larry. Overall, his command of the subject is impressive but not surprising given his experience. Everything he teaches in based off of textbooks or some source so you know what you're learning is legit and is following some level of a standard (and not just the arbitrary musings of some researcher). He comes off as a little passive agressive sometimes, but in a funny way and only when its warranted (a kid won't stop asking questions that are pointless and interrupt class, someone asks a question that was just answered, etc.). His slides were also pretty good, sort of dense but filled with useful motivating examples. The worst part of this experience with him was that it felt like he was always being hampered down by coteaching with Cliff, which makes sense. This is a man with 20+ years of educational experience, coming from the University of Minnesota and GWU (with raving reviews at both) and he shouldn't really have to coteach so I hope he isn't in the future. The projects that he himself wrote (project 7 and 8) were easier to understand and do compared to the collaborative ones which is good and I felt like I put in my time, learned something, and could walk away happy.

Kauffman has 'engagement points', which are optional extra-credit opportunities.

He moves a little fast, but he did record and has good slides so that was rarely a concern. Ask questions.
