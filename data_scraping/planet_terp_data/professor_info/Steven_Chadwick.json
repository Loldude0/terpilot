He also provides past semester exams both in discussion as practice, and online. He does answer questions during lectures, but you'd be more likely to receive the best response if you stay after the lecture, as he doesn't mind writing on the chalkboard to re-explain a topic. The homework assignments are a lot more difficult than content discussed the day of in lecture, so it's also recommended you form study groups. I'd say one should expect to be teaching themselves. The quizzes are simple, maybe one or two questions, and less difficult than discussion worksheets and homework assignments. It'd behoove one to review lecture notes daily, understand how to solve the homework questions (instead of resorting to Google), and go to TA office hours, as well as the professor's own. Professor Chadwick certainly wasn't the best, but as it's my first semester, I can't compare him with other math professors.

I have enjoyed being in his class and the one thing making me from going off the rails is my TA. Chadwick lets you know that this course is not going to be easy. The one thing I like about his class are how his midterms are structured, as each midterm appears to be \"unit tests\" for each chapter we have covered in class. The midterms are hard, but he gives a midterm from the previous year and a sample midterm before each exam so they prepare you very well. I have had friends in this class who self-study and do incredibly well without having to go to lectures. Professor Chadwick makes the effort to answer questions and is genuinely a nice person. The web-assigns and discussion worksheets he gives are fair, BUT are harder than what we have covered in class (they aren't really good review material, but if you work well with other people in your class it should be fine). The quizzes are similar to class notes. Speaking of notes, although he does cover everything that is in the textbook and curriculum, he tends to skip steps during class due to time so if you need any clarifications, speak up! He sometimes goes over time but the most I have seen is him going over the time by around one or two minutes. He will tell you what is on the exams and what is not on the exam, such as particular proofs that he teaches you (proofs won't be on the exam and you don't have to know it for any exams, but he has said that it is good to know). \r\n\r\nOne helpful thing I would say is to go to his office hours whenever you get the chance or whenever you do not understand anything. Also, take good notes as they are helpful. Calculus 1 isn't that bad if you practice and take the time to learn or even ask questions. There are a lot of resources online to help you if you do not have the time to go to office hours. Plus, Chadwick gives you extra problems from the textbook for you to practice with. The web-assigns are similar to the problems on the textbook too. Everyone can do well in this class if they put in the work.\r\n\r\nOverall, Chadwick is an honest and prepares you well for the final. He does curve a little bit for the final as well. If you have taken AP calculus AB or BC before, that background knowledge can be decently helpful, but as usual, the AP calculus courses doesn't cover everything in calculus as calculus 1 in UMD covers some things you might have not seen before, and a lot of content you recognize previously in your AP calculus class. Personally, Chadwick's class goes as fast as AP calculus BC. Although I was able to keep up with his lectures, I am aware that some others are unable to keep up with his teaching and what I can say about that is to practice or even watch videos to try and understand. On midterms, he does give out partial credit unless said so otherwise (for example: on one of the midterms, Chadwick said that if we did not get the derivative correctly, we will receive 0 points on that question, which is honestly understandable, I don't know how you're getting through calculus with the wrong derivatives). All in all, he does a good job teaching and doesn't get enough credit for it.\r\n\r\nShoutout to my TA for being the best and the most helpful :)", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "", "created": "2022-12-24T00:04:21.165802Z"}, {"professor": "Steven Chadwick", "course": "MATH140", "review": "For everybody saying this guy is an amazing teacher, is lying.

So if you already have a strong understanding of Calculus, you should do okay. If you had never taken Calculus, it will be a struggle for you.

Hands-down, Professor Chadwick was the worst mathematics teacher I have ever gotten. Accompanied by the fact that I have never learned Calculus in my life, his explanations were dull and his methods of teaching were non-existent. In fact, it got so bad to the point where I never showed up for class and had to learn derivation and other topics all on my own. Even for students who have taken calculus in high school, he does NOT teach and you will be sitting in a room for an hour and 30 minutes that consists of him doing textbook problems on his own and talking to himself. On that note, his method of \"teaching\" is to just translate the whole book word-by-word verbally which helps literally no one. He often skips steps on problems and rushes which leads to a lot of questions. As for his responses, they are all so convoluted that it makes everything more confusing than if he would have just ignored questions altogether. When he asks students if they understand, they would nod their heads and just stay silent for the remainder of the hour (or year for that matter).\r\n\r\nChadwick does NOT curve, mostly does NOT offer partial points, and does NOT record lectures. One more important thing to note is that Chadwick's exams do NOT have any WebAssign problems nor any resemblance to the study guides he gives us. Do not expect to succeed unless you have taken Calculus before and even then, it's still difficult to pass. Every positive review about Chadwick is, by assumption, a student who has taken Calculus in high school or someone who failed and is trying to get others to fail alongside them. Again, to reiterate, I have never taken a year of Calculus prior to Chadwick and only by sacrificing marks of other classes and using external resources did I manage to pass.\r\n\r\nNow onwards to the Math Department as a whole. Math at UMD is so comically difficult that it should be considered a cruel and unusual punishment. They do a terrible job at writing exams relative to the time students spend on each topic/chapter. Students have other responsibilities, however UMD math still continues to assign weekly quizzes, biweekly exams, and unforgiving WebAssign due dates (7 AM every Tues/Thurs). Not to mention that WebAssigns on average take 5 or more hours to finish because of the nature of the problems. I recommend everyone to steer FAR FAR away from the math department at UMD or transfer credits over from a community college.", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "B", "created": "2023-03-10T20:51:01.565171Z"}, {"professor": "Steven Chadwick", "course": "MATH140", "review": "Great professor.

All of this is to say that even though Chadwick could improve some aspects of his class -- in fact, I found Williams to be a much more engaging lecturer -- Chadwick's exams are far more forgiving.
