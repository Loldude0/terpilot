But Professor Dennie was very chill, at times it seemed he really didn\u2019t care too much about assignment specifics or even if a student shows up late to class\u2014minor things like that. Which was great! he really was so kind and accommodating and the class did have very complex readings not going to lie, and were rather boring in my opinion. But the class discussion he leads makes it worth it in my opinion\u2014and very entertaining. You read from several different novels, so it\u2019s pretty reading heavy. I don\u2019t think it was too assignment heavy, and attendance wasn\u2019t absolutely required, although I wouldn\u2019t recommend skipping out too much because you do have to present a chapter in a book where you teach the class through ppt. And there\u2019s a few papers and a course playlist. But really, it\u2019s not bad at all. I actually liked it even though it wasn\u2019t the most interesting literature for me personally.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "", "created": "2023-09-04T07:59:28.284697Z"}, {"professor": "Chauncey Dennie", "course": "AASP298L", "review": "Chill professor, Slightly boring literature, Great Discussions, Reasonable Assignments. He didn\u2019t really care about attendance or being nitpicky with assignment criteria which I found awesome! Our class discussions were very entertaining and you sign up for a presentation slot to present a specific part in the book the class reads. But you also have to participate in class debate with other groups who ask you questions about the novel. And a course playlist and a few papers at most. But this class was fair! It wasn\u2019t the most interesting class out there for me personally because of the literature. And also, this was a last-minute decision class.
