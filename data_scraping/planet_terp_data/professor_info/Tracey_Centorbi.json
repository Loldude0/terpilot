All in all I spent at least 10+ hours a week for this professor alone. Exam weeks easily make this go to 15+. This is an absurd amount of work for an 100 level course. \r\n\r\nEach exam covered 3 chapters. It might not seem like much but take my word, it's a lot. Of everything that could be on the exam, we were tested on the simplest things like identifying different kinds of rocks.\r\n\r\nI gave two starts because she's a really nice person, but a mean professor.

It wasn't the worst class and not too difficult in my opinion. She would publish a bunch of lecture videos each Monday that would range from 5 to 20 minutes each and were easy to follow along with, just extremely boring. Embedded in the lecture videos were quiz questions about the content of the lectures, and some weeks these questions were retakeable until you got them right, and sometimes they weren't, there was no pattern to it. You would also be assigned a chapter to read each week from the textbook, and the textbook was interactive so there was a grade for completing the questions for each chapter. Most weeks I didn't even read the chapter and just answered the questions until I got them all right (they were graded for completion). My biggest complaint about this class is that the quizzes we had each week were created through the textbook service, so the questions were based entirely off of the textbook and not the lectures at all. Luckily, the quizzes are open note and you get two tries on them. There was a midterm roughly every three weeks in this class, and the midterms were based off of the lectures. The midterms also felt very \"unpolished,\" there were often repeated questions, etc. Centorbi would also use a browser extension to prevent cheating on the exams that would film you the entire time. I would definitely study for the exams, but they weren't extremely difficult. She also had no TAs for this class, so the only way to contact her outside of emailing was her office hours that were only hosted once a week. Overall, not too difficult of a class, but definitely not an easy A if you don't have at least some interest in the subject.", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "", "created": "2021-01-13T00:12:00Z"}, {"professor": "Tracey Centorbi", "course": "GEOL100", "review": "I took Tracey Centorbi's class in the fall of 2020.

She says that she builds her exams mainly on the lecture videos she posts, the textbook material only factors a small amount into the exam. She also uses Honorlock. However, after discussions with the students, she removed all of Honorlock's predatory requirements.\r\n\r\nIn the final month, the class took a turn for the better. Due to the pandemic, the college allowed professors to make finals optional. The professor did, which allowed most of us to save our grades.

As for the lab, we were not given the right resources to prepare for it, and most people in my section barely got higher than a C. Also, on the midterms, because she uses some randomized testing feature, you can get asked the same question 5-7 times and you will get points taken off for each one so good luck if you don't know the answer. She also refuses to listen to critiques of this testing system and you cannot argue points back if this happens to you.
