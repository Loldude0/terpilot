I think he did a good job teaching this class; needless to say, this was a very challenging course (more so than 412 in my opinion). \n\r\nThis class is conceptually simple, but the devil truly is in the details. Understanding how packets are routed through the internet is not a trivial matter. This requires understanding link-layer switching, and network-layer routing. I think Bobby did a rather crappy job explaining the link-layer. In particular, he failed to articulate the difference between forwarding and routing (which is HUGE). This certainly led to a lot of confusion.\n\r\nEither way, take this course with either Bobby or Neil Spring.

This is the first course I have taken at UMD that does not provide at least some form of slides or an outline on the material covered in class. The problem with this practice is that his exams, while open note, are 100% based on content he covers in class so if you miss class and office hours & do not take detailed notes in class you're basically screwed.\r\n\r\nWhile all my other professors have been uploading recordings of their lectures, Bobby refuses. He will likely claim that because people joining on Zoom do not give their express consent to be recorded he won't do it or something to that effect, but if he actually cared he would use Panopto or some other solution.\r\n\r\nComing back to in person after 3 semesters of remote learning is tough, and since I am still used to asynchronous learning it has been a particular struggle for me to stay on top of projects and study for exams in this course.\r\n\r\nTLDR: Bobby's attitude and expectations for the course leave a lot to be desired, and his teaching skills are not that of a professor who should be making a $200,000/year+ salary (which is likely due to his research and tenure at the university but still).

I wish that we had fewer projects and more time to work on them, as they would often be a matter of \"write until time is over\" instead of \"write until your project is working/complete\".

", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A-", "created": "2021-12-20T21:23:12Z"}, {"professor": "Samrat Bhattacharjee", "course": "CMSC417", "review": "Although I have a W, I have decided to audit this class and do the projects at my own pace. I was struggling with finding a job and made the mistake of taking another extremely programming-heavy course and I wasn't confident enough in C to finish the projects without error. I hope whoever reads these reviews knows that the 5-star reviews are not given by \"normal\" people. They're either really good at C, very passionate about networking, or just don't care about red flags. These are people who are not bothered by Bobby's demeanor or attitude and fail to realize that although they had a good experience, there are many people in the class who don't. \r\n\r\nI want to give a rather detailed review. I think Bobby's teaching philosophy can be somewhat debatable, so I'll mention what can be done better: [-]: negative or can be improved upon. [?] Depends on your perspective. [+] Undisputable good quality\r\n\r\n[-] Not recording lectures or office hours: I think the whole idea behind this is that when people know a lecture is being recorded, they stop attending class. Although this is true, we have to see if this is a good thing or a bad thing for the students. It might be demoralizing for the professor since he might not be able to interact with a class and you could argue this is bad for the students since some students are lazy and fall behind schedule because \"everything is recorded\". So let's analyze this in detail: [+] Bobby provides OH \"relectures\" for people who missed the class. [-] Bobby does not record OH even if people have other classes during the time of OH and sometimes refuses to discuss what was mentioned in detail because he \"discussed it many times in OH\". [-] Some students like me usually will rewatch lectures to fill in missing gaps in our knowledge, not having lectures recorded means we have to go on Piazza but given the next bullet points this isn't so \"smooth\". Overall, I think if Bobby wants people to attend lectures, he should find a way to take attendance and leverage it in part with the participation grade. \r\n\r\n[-] Being demeaning to the students: This is an area Bobby needs to work on for sure. You can't go out there and call people stupid or get annoyed when people can't grasp concepts easily. I've seen instances where he literally said \"this is a stupid question\" even when the question was somewhat relevant. Maybe this might be why he doesn't record.......\r\n\r\n[?] Not giving previous exam solutions:  This is probably a blessing in disguise. You are forced to learn where and how to find the information you need instead of having them given to you and just learning through pattern matching. I think this is a good thing but you can easily argue this is a bad thing.\r\n\r\n[?] Projects take up too much time: The tradeoff is that the projects are cool and useful on your CV. If you take this class, you should be informed that it is hard and a lot of work. Don't make the mistake of taking this with other hard classes.\r\n\r\n[+] Great Lecturer: Bobby can explain concepts well and you get engaged rather easily\r\n\r\nOverall, Bobby is your stereotypical grandiose narcissist who has a valid reason to be narcissistic. I rate him 3 stars because I feel like Bobby is an amazing lecturer but the 2 [-] are what makes him rather unpleasant. I have a feeling that even if he is given similar feedback from other students, he might not listen to them and continue with his current ways.", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "W", "created": "2022-11-19T21:09:59.646751Z"}, {"professor": "Samrat Bhattacharjee", "course": "CMSC417", "review": "Best CS course I've taken in terms of knowledge learned.\r\n\r\nIt's true this class is hard, and it will probably hurt your GPA.

His lectures can be very engaging since he is highly knowledgeable, funny, and interacts with his class often, but whether it be on piazza or in lecture, he will berate you infront of everyone; although; will help you nonetheless. Bobby is a cool dude and does have a soft side, It just sucks because there are more instances where he is hella rude than decent. There was one instance during a zoom OH where he openly stated a question was stupid and forced another student to answer it instead. Although I did say he can be rude to everyone, I have noticed that he is kinder to smarter students that don't irritate him. \r\n\r\nWith regards to the actual course: this class is essentially two classes at once: the lecture side will cover things on the exam, but the projects are completely self taught. Bobby will not teach you how to code sockets, instead he will provide sources and then you have to figure it out. Do not take this class if you are not confident in your coding ability YET. MAN pages will be your bible. There are no recordings, and the class notes are the scribble scrabble he does during lecture. \r\n\r\nAll-in-all: I do think you should take this class. I know my grade and review says otherwise, but you WILL learn a lot if you take this class, and it definitely forces you to become a better programmer. If you are going to take this class, make sure you have the time to give it your all. Most importantly - become a competent programmer before taking the class if you're not already.

Only Chord and BitTorrent had a lecture dedicated to them, and those lectures were essentially useless to implementing the projects. He gives you 2 weeks to complete the project, and I can attest that you will need every minute of those 2 weeks. Project scores required 15-20 hours to get a 50% in my experience. There are no public or release tests given, and the rubric in the assignment does not match the grades i.e. the first project said you'd get an A if your server could handle multiple clients. Mine could and I got a 55% because of some corner cases I didn't test with my client, NOT my server.\r\n\r\nThe only saving grace in this class are the exams.
