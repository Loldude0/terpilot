I had her for all of Media Scholars and loved the experience. She's very open and relatable with her students, and does a great job of making them passionate about media through plenty of diverse guest speakers and discussion activity. When I was having a hard time with the death of a loved one, she went out of her way to make sure that not only I could come to the Scholars field trip in the midst of the tragedy, but she also invited my parents to help them have a nice distraction.\r\n\r\nAwesome human being, very open, caring, and altruistic.

Alison is such a caring person and is very receptive to any life events or stress you may have, if you're being bogged down by other classes, have outside life events interfering, etc. she will almost always give you an extension or even excuse the assignment entirely. Most assignment deadlines are more like suggestions than hard rules, and the assignments themselves are usually just attending some group activity (they really want you to bond lol) or reflective discussion post.
