Overall, when you go to the class, it will probably be like an in-class activity that you have to complete with your group. In the beginning of the semester, you can choose where you sit, but eventually you will be assigned a permanent group that you'll complete the final group project with. The activities are really easy to complete too. However the majority of your grade is from the homework assignments and group projects. For the homework assignments, they were usually to read an article and write a few notes on it or something you learned, and took around 30 minutes to complete so it wasn't bad at all. The group projects took a little more time, but still less than an hour or an hour and a half. For the group projects, Prof. O'Hara graded a little more strictly than the homework assignments, but still was a fair grade overall. Plus, for one of the assignments she re-grades the group project, so it shouldn't be anything too harmful to your grade. The group assignment was basically being assigned a research question and then finding scientific articles related to the topic, and then analyzing a graph and summarizing the different components of the articles. At the end of the semester, the group will present for 4 minutes on the findings, but it wasn't anything too stressful or time-consuming. There was also no final or midterm. I think the benefits of the class is that you'll learn how to read a scientific article and learn how to summarize/present information, and Prof. O'Hara is a very approachable and kind person if you have any questions at all.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-12-29T23:32:33.258646Z"}, {"professor": "Jessica O'Hara", "course": "FIRE120", "review": "FIRE120 is a very easy 3 credit class.
