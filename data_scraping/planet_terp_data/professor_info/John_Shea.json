It can be tough, but the best advice I can give is to audio record the lectures and listen to them later.\r\nWhat is the best about Professor Shea is that when it comes down to it, he's a really understanding guy.

When you do find yourself paying attention, you'll see he knows his stuff. It's actually very impressive. However, the way he goes about presenting the information you need to know is abysmal and dry.\n\r\nHe really doesn't go by the textbook at all (I haven't opened it once all year and my final is next week.) Having said that, it means you have to go to class and take really good notes because the exams do come straight from what he writes down, which is a plus I guess. Although, none of the in-class notes are electronic (no powerpoints, nothing on ELMS besides practice exams or problem set answers), so when you inevitably tune him out, you're going to fall behind. He will only write on the chalkboard, which can be brutal when you can't read the handwriting/tune out for a few minutes and fall behind.\n\r\nAs for the class, he's solid as a grader, and this is why I gave him a 3 star rating. Two exams, a final, and problem sets. The problem sets are very easy to get full points on, which translates to 15% of your final grade. The exams, while they can be tough, are very similar to his old exams and are curved, which is really nice.\n\r\nIf you can bear to pay attention twice a week for an hour and fifteen minutes, it shouldn't be too bad and you can do very well.

I respect him for being able to lecture and write on the chalkboard for an hour and 15 min straight.

He goes over points in a somewhat logical manner  and tries to tie them in to current events. He'll even crack the occasional joke or two. \n\r\nTips to do really well:\r\n1) Sometimes his notes on the board aren't very organized. I would take the time to rewrite, or type (which I did) your notes. \r\n2) Do not simply memorize, but understand the logic behind it. He usually explains the logic verbally, so try to listen as you're writing. I was never a verbal learner, so I kind of found it difficult to follow him when he talked. *This is more important for the new material he teaches for the final.*\r\n3) Highlight/mark up important dates. There are always 2-3 questions on the exams that ask for those dates. It hurts if you miss those, since each exam is 30 questions. (Final is 40)\r\n4) Do all your homework. Don't be lazy. It's an easy 100% because it's graded for effort. And they help you study for the exams. He does drop the lowest score out of all of them.\r\n5)The format of his practice exams are very similar to the actual midterms. The questions aren't, because his lectures slightly differ from year to year. But it's a great study tool, because you can see what concepts are behind each question.\r\n6)Don't rely on the curve too much. But by god, I love the curves for this class. He does it by aiming for his target distribution of grades.\r\nNote: I don't think students can fail this class... unless they put in 0 effort.

He\u2019s incredibly caring, knowledgeable, and thorough. Nothing on exams should be a surprise because they\u2019re worded exactly like the practice exams and problem sets. I thought the exams were very reasonable and reflected the course. Plus there\u2019s a great curve. You can tell he loves what he teaches and he\u2019s brilliant. One of the best at UMD.

His knowledge and passion for Econ is clear in the way he gives his lectures. The material is pretty dry most of the time, but easy to learn. Grading is also super fair, we had problem sets every week graded for completion and two midterms + a final. You get to make a double-sided formula sheet for both midterms and two double sided formula sheets for the final. There are also discussion boards on ELMS for all of the chapters where you can post questions for him to answer, which is super helpful for the exams. The curve at the end of class is also very, very generous.
