His lectures are boring and have little engagement. Some of his assignments can be straight up disgusting and will destroy your will to live.

DVH lectures well, but can be monotone, which can make it difficult to stay focused if you're easily distracted like I am. Outside of lecture, a Discord server was set up for the class. This was massive since it made communication between course staff and students more frequent, casual, and clear. It closed a lot of distance between the two groups. The format of Discord also made it so that problems students had could be solved more smoothly than they would on something like Piazza. DVH is also very kind in general. If he's an option, I'd highly recommend taking him, because he knows how to run a course.

First, he cares about students and their learning. His main objective is encourage students to learn as much as possible. His lectures are clear and he never rushes through the materials, which are well organized into different modules with increasing levels of sophistication to build up compilers with advanced programming language features. \r\n\r\nI like the way the course organizes exams. We had two midterms but no final exam. The midterm problems are all about designing and implementing certain features of some compilers that had been discussed in the lectures. The midterm questions are clear and reasonable.

One of the most well put together classes I've ever taken. Seriously. A lot of time went into the design of this course, so that you wouldn't spend hours and hours sifting through documentation for an answer. Most upper level classes will say its the students job to find out what functions to use to solve a problem, and what resources to get there. But everything you need for this class is in the notes and in lecture, so you can spend more time thinking about the theory, and doing projects then sifting through pages and pages of documentation. They even made a language to simplify x86 to only instructions that are relevant. On top of that, DVH lectures very well, attempting to explain those notes and boiler plate code with live coding examples. He doesn't just teach off slides he actually shows you what to do and tells you why he's doing it that way. Very good lecturer. But don't get me wrong this class isn't easy, you definitely will have to think your way through the projects and some projects I was just grateful to get a C. But I took it in the summer so maybe less time made it harder, I don't know. After one of the project deadlines passed that a lot of people struggled on, DVH spent 3+ hours walking through the solution on top of doing lecture that day. Him and his TA are also very responsive. This summer Pierce was one of the TA's and one of the best ones I've ever had. Anyways, take this class if you liked the interpreter project of 330 and the MIPs project of 216, because its sort of a blend of those 2 projects. This is one of those classes where effort and consistency will get you farther than intuition and I really think the staff gives you every tool you need to succeed.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "B", "created": "2023-06-29T04:49:24.692015Z"}, {"professor": "David Van Horn", "course": "CMSC430", "review": "Most checked out professor ever, course was terribly organized.\r\nApparently he did not interact with the TAs all semester and it showed.\r\nProjects were almost always posted late.
