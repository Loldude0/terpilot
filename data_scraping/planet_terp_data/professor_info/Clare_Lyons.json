She was a great lecturer and was always well-prepared for class with an outline, primary documents, and interesting movies. \n\r\nShe definitely expects a lot from her students--there was tons of reading every week. As long as you keep up with the reading, you should easily pull off an A in the class. \n\r\nThis is also not a class where you can expect to skip lecture and just do the readings on your own. I missed lecture once and missed a huge chunk of information. Thankfully, the midterm and final consist of 6-8 identifications (basically stating why the topic is important to the history of sexuality) and a paper that is 70% of the midterm.

I took this class because I dropped another class and needed something to fill my schedule.  I would not take this again if I had the option.  The topic is so boring I pretty much stopped going to lecture half way through because I couldn't stand it, although going to lecture is kind of important because she doesn't post her outlines online.  There was a lot of reading each week, often dealing with obsure, bland topics such as the treatment of black laudry women in atlanta after the civil war.  The paper you have to write is also extremely boring and you have to write it on the book she wrote.  Overall the material is easy to grasp (the answer to every question in this class is prostitution)but there was way to much pointless busy work, I felt like I was in high school again.
