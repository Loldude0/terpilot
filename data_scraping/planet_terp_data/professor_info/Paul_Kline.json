His lectures are very casual and are usually decent, albeit they do have mistakes in them quite often which he does catch in class. Not a huge detriment but it does make it slightly annoying. He records all his lectures as well which is again, very helpful. \r\n\r\nKline also is one of the profs who does not weigh tests heavily as part of your 250 grades. Your quizzes and homework can be a huge grade booster in that regard which can be helpful.\r\nHis exams are also noticeably on the easier side I feel. The grade averages for my semester were around ~90%+ for Exam 1 (INSANE!) ~80% for Exam 2 and 3, and the final (with the final being slightly lower than 80% in the high 70s)\r\n\r\nWhile these are good averages, they aren't crazy, but I'd imagine the majority of the class passes with a higher grade due to the homework and quiz having higher weights. Additionally, all the extra credit in the course probably adds up to 3%+ (There is extra credit on some tests which is hard, and homework extra credit which I will get to later)\r\n\r\nTHE BAD:\r\nOh boy, where to begin? Kline is virtually nonexistent outside of lectures. He outsources everything to the TAs. They make the homework, the quizzes, answer all the Piazza posts, grade everything. This can lead to some issues.\r\n\r\nThe \"Style-Guide\" is a style reference that we are supposed to use when doing all our homework and quizzes. Unfortunately, because this is a TA resource, at times it is disconnected from what Kline teaches. On more than one occasion (INCLUDING AN EXAM!!!) the style that Kline wished us to use did not match the style guide from the TAs. While this usually ends up not harming your grade directly, it can make the questions much more confusing and unnecessarily hard.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, due to this disconnect, there are SO MANY occasions where quiz or homework questions are flat out DROPPED because they either had style mismatches or other issues that made them not be graded and gave everyone a 100% for them. One quiz we took had 3 questions, and 2/3 were dropped. While this is good for the student as they get free points, it is highly annoying and clearly a sign of a disorganized class. It can also feel discouraging to put in effort on homework only for it to not matter once the question is dropped.\r\n\r\nNow onto the major point of contention: THE HOMEWORKS\r\nThe TAs write all the homework and they subscribe to the policy of \"Hard Homework\" preps you for the exam. And by Hard I mean that the homework are a MAGNITUDE harder and can get downright crazy. The infamous HW4 had an average completion time of over 10 hours for the majority of the course. Some homework got to 14 pages long. It's bad. The TAs eventually chilled near the end of the semester after all the complaints, so perhaps my dear future terp you will have it easier. Just be warned though, it can get bad! OH or internet searching on proofwiki and other things is downright required sometimes for some of the more insane proofs.\r\n\r\nTo compensate there is a flat 8% bonus extra credit if you use LaTex for your homework. This adds up to about 2.5% extra credit for your entire course grade which is very nice and the sole saving grace of turning your homework averages high. \r\n\r\n\r\nTl;DR\r\nTHE SUMMARY:\r\nKline is a decent prof who outsources his work to the TAs. It is easy to get a good grade in this class due to easy exams and frequent extra credit, but the workload for this class can be high due to difficult homework. If you are ok with spending a lot of time in this course but an easier course grade-wise, take Kline.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "B", "created": "2023-05-26T05:32:45.242011Z"}, {"professor": "Paul Kline", "course": "CMSC250", "review": "Great and down to earth guy.

If you have a question, he'll go for hours 1 on 1 with you in office hours until you understand it. \r\n- Lectures were clear, cogent, and recorded (slides were posted too). Idk what other ppl are talking abt when it comes to his lecturing; he has genuine passion for the subject and that comes to life in his lecturing.

Paul's exams were EZ: Exam 1: 89 median, Exam 2: 75 median, Exam 3: 94 median, Final: 84. Yes, exam 2 was a little tough, but the other exams more than made up for it. \r\n- The homework point is the one I really don't understand. The homeworks are substantial, and usually harder than the exams (which means you can walk into the exams and kill it bc you've literally done harder stuff). Tbh, not one took me more than 4-5 hours and I got either 97s or 100s on them. Most were a 2-3 hour job. If you go to office hours (shout-out to Rushil!!!) you'll be totally fine on them.

It's slow (kinda understandable given that there are 300+ students and it's a proof based course, but still) and the grading TAs can vary wildly. Some have absolutely no chill, so make sure to format your quantifiers and proof goals correctly bc they'll rip you to shreds over the small stuff. \r\n- Poorly worded questions: Towards the end of the semester, homeworks and quizzes starting being hosted on ELMS (I assume for the autograding since they were behind, see prev point). The problem was, they kept entering in the wrong answers or the wrong questions. I remember one problem asked about straights (in poker), but you had to somehow assume they meant straight flushes (very different answer!!). This happened to some extent earlier in the semester (homework questions were changed/reworded), but it got really bad at the end.\r\n- Some flip-flopping in discussion formats.

Also there are 5 quizzes the semester that you take online for two hours that have a 90% average plus on every single one of them. He's not perfect but he's getting there he's been shortening the homeworks as time goes by so hopefully the issues people have with him will be gone soon and people will realize how much of a great teacher he is.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "A-", "created": "2023-12-20T02:34:59.693977Z"}, {"professor": "Paul Kline", "course": "CMSC250", "review": "(Note: this review is from the perspective of a transfer full-time student who also works a couple of part-time jobs)\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of bad reviews or mixed reviews on Professor Kline that resulted from exam 2 but in my opinion I feel as though the class is worth taking with Paul.\r\n\r\nAt first every assignment including exam 1 was do-able and pretty simple material to follow except quiz 1 since it was the first quiz and you have nothing to prepare you for the following quizzes except that one. The structure of the class is really fair and allows for flexibility to get a passing grade. Lowest 1 quiz and 1 homework dropped, homeworks every week have a grace period of 2 days for full credit, extra credit was given just for showing up to discussion, & even recorded lectures. With all of this, it was good for me as a part time employee and student to be able to complete my work for full credit on days when I\u2019d be at my job for majority of the week. I will say material and assignments get harder and tricker after exam 1 but that\u2019s with any class in comp sci tbh. \r\n\r\nNow homeworks are very tedious and it\u2019s best to start at the beginning of the week and you\u2019re able to work with other students which is good. One reason I give this class a 4 instead of 5 star is because of TA grading. You can always of course do regrade requests but sometimes it felt like the smallest mistake could result in a lot of points being taken away. Same thing for certain exam questions.\r\n\r\nNow to be frank I am the type of student who just wants to get my credits and go. It\u2019s hard managing jobs and school so I can take what I can get. I did well on exam one, poor on exam 2 and the final, and decent on exam 3 and still managed to get the credits due to maintaining my homeworks and doing good on my quizzes, as well as the gracious amount of extra credit opportunities. Being that everyone isn\u2019t on the same boat as me, if you\u2019re able to focus on school full time or have an excellent schedule and time management skills, this class will be good for you. I don\u2019t have those and i still passed so honestly not as bad as everyone is making it because I\u2019m sure most of them passed anyway.

However, that turned out to be a fat lie.\r\n\r\nLectures:\r\nStarting with lectures, he speaks too quickly, often skipping essential steps in a lesson and assuming students will understand or skipping because it's too much to explain for this lecture, and he does not feel like going in-depth. Even though he records them, these recordings are often released days after lectures. At times, students had to ask for them since he did not upload them promptly. Personally, after the first exam, I stopped regularly attending lectures and only came to talk with friends or because I had nothing else to do. Attending, other than for exams, was a huge waste of time if I was not going to get anything from it. His lecture style also focused on engaging only the front row of students, and there was always a correction or mistake made in his lecture slides, which was confusing in terms of formatting work.\r\n\r\nHomework:\r\nThe homework is probably the most difficult and time-consuming assignment in this class. Although it prepares you for the exams, the amount is ridiculous, considering we have other classes and work to balance alongside the homework. Moreover, they were weekly assignments, so most of your week was spent trying to figure out what the homework was even asking for. I feel as though there were also a lot of mistakes in the homework at times, and you would likely have to go to office hours to understand some problems since they often included extended problems we may not have talked about in class.\r\n\r\nExams/Quizzes:\r\nThe quizzes were not too bad. I would just say that at the beginning of the semester, we had quizzes on topics we had not gone in-depth into in the lecture or homework, which meant unless you did all the homework initially, the quiz might have been slightly more difficult. Overall, the exams were not too bad either as long as you understood the homework, quizzes, and discussion worksheets. The only thing that I disliked about the exams was how heavy they were with content, having multiple sections of multiple choice and more sections of free response. For the second exam, there were a lot of sections of questions and content, and not enough time to answer them, which led to the average being the lowest in the class because most people did not finish. Something else I found frustrating was the number of corrections made during the exams. You would think they have all this time to make the exam and go through them for any mistakes, but for every exam and even in the final, there was always some sort of correction to be made, which was very annoying in my opinion. Sometimes, they did not even announce the correction out loud; they just wrote it on the board and assumed you would look up.\r\n\r\nFinal Review:\r\nThe TAs in this class were never on the same page regarding what they were looking for when it came to assignments, so it was very disorganized. Kline is merely the professor, but the TAs run the class. Kline is not as accessible to contact outside of class apart from his office hours which are only about twice a week for 1-2 hours. I would say you're better off just using Justin's 250 notes, which is what I did. I barely even bothered to use Kline's slides after the second exam. All in all, a very disorganized class.
