The course load is heavy, but she makes it significantly better. She provides in-depth comments/feedback on all assignments and genuinely wants her students to succeed. Anna makes note of common mistakes students have in their writing and provides helpful in-class examples of how to resolve them and improve our technique. My writing had improved tremendously because of this class.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2022-12-06T18:46:08.149636Z"}, {"professor": "Anna Josephson", "course": "ENGL398E", "review": "Great teacher. Class is a lot of work, although I assume all of the professional writing classes are similar.
