Homework and exams are reasonable in difficulty, maybe on the easier side compared to the more theoretical courses. The math is explained very clearly and in a way that is easy to understand, but this also results in the pacing being slower than typical math classes.

The class was only 75 minutes but he regularly took breaks from lecturing and talked with the class about sports or funny stories from his life. The workload was not too much there were just 5 problem sets in the semester, there was an in-class midterm but take-home final. Also he writes the lectures on ipad notes instead of the whiteboard and posts them to elms which is nice.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2022-12-30T05:25:34.530342Z"}], "name": "Howard Elman", "slug": "elman_howard"}
