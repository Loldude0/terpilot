Overall, I found his teaching style to be effective. He clearly has a specific lesson plan that he goes by. At the beginning of the semester he spends time reviewing the map of Africa(learn everything about the map. Don't  choke, like me, when he calls on you), and then he gets into the actual material. \r\nThere seemed to be a lack of organization when it came to our assignments, and he straight up ignored a few of our assignments, granted he had family problems going on during the semester.

He always goes over class time, every time, and it is frustrating, especially for someone who has a class right after. He is not respectful of students' time, is unclear about when assignments are due, assignments are worded poorly and are often very confusing, he never provides a rubric, and his feedback is often on grammar and not sustenance.
