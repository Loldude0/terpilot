The course is taught on an online textbook that costs $35, with some self-evaluations (no studying needed, likert scale questions). The quizzes posted on canvas sometimes have things that aren't covered in the book, as far as I could tell, but are overall pretty easy. You don't have to actually show up to class for a while, until you need groups for the group project.\r\n\r\nPratt just isn't a good lecturer though. He often prods for definitions of specific terms until he gets the one he's expecting, which can get tiring. He also can get pretty \"rambly/make it up as you go\" sometimes, since there isn't a ton of content to cover, but about half way through he usually lets out.\r\n\r\nThere's also times where he comes off pretty self-righteous. As an example, when someone was calmly walking out during class, Pratt repeatedly asked him \"am I boring you?\" multiple times, to which the student replied that he had a meeting. Pratt then said \"that's how you make a bad impression on your professor.\"", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2022-12-02T07:37:00.226514Z"}, {"professor": "Michael Pratt", "course": "ENES140", "review": "Course is easy.
