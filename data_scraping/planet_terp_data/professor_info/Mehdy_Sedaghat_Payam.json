Easily one of the best professors I've ever had. This course is not too much work (1 presentation, a few discussion posts, and a final paper) and is pretty fun. He did originally have like 5 novels we had to read but after he realized no one felt like reading them he switched to movies instead. Take this class if you want an easy A and are open to learning new things.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-05-12T05:54:47.917791Z"}, {"professor": "Mehdy Sedaghat Payam", "course": "CMLT270", "review": "Amazing prof. So well minded, relatable, and educated. 1 7-10min presentation on any topic (book, song, movie, show, poem, ads, literally anything), around 3 discussion posts, and a final paper that is super vague. Prof grades off of completion (no one got lower than a 100% on the final or any assignments for that matter). Had a couple novels for us to read but changed some to movies and has us read less when he realized no one was reading them. The class is mainly discussion based and super interesting.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-06-20T21:03:19.247187Z"}], "name": "Mehdy Sedaghat Payam", "slug": "payam"}
