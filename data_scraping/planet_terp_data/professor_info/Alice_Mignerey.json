She studies nuclear chemistry which is quite advanced compared to the introductory Chem 131. So i can't review how she teaches other chem courses.\n\r\nHowever! Even the smartest people can be the worst of teachers. Mignerey is one poor professor.\n\r\nHer lectures are read off of less than descriptive power points. Her shinannagins in class result from her inability to demostrate concepts correctly.\n\r\nFurthermore, asking questions to her in the middle of class is a joke. She gets mad so easily and instead of elaborating on a concept she just says \"it's like this right?...see right.\" She assumes the student knows the very questioned they asked about, which is silly because then why would they ask.\n\r\nThe most frustrating part! In her minimal effort to explain things she uses her stupid catch phrase \"boot strap ourselves through it.\" This is a cop out as a professor who is basically is using a poor analogy to explain a concept in chemistry. \n\r\nShe also has some ghoulish henceboy named Paul Diss who has inhereted Mignerey's inability to teach effectively, not to mention her snotty attitude. These two combined really make  the class an uncomfortable learning environment because they are always looking down their noses at students. It's sad they functionally exist in a teaching capacity. \n\r\nTesting: The tests are probably equivalent to other chem131 courses in terms of difficulty, but the professor does little to provide fundamental information in a coherent manner. Her class averages are depressingly low. The results you see on this website are most likely used after <50% of the class drops the course. \n\r\nThe TA's are the saving grace of Mignerey's career.

She makes so many mistakes in her lectures that many students find it more useful to NOT attend her lectures and read the slides themselves. On top of her terrible, almost non-existent teaching skills, she assigns the most painfully tedious and boring homework. No joke, I have recorded almost 90+ hours on ALEKS (the homework software) which she also assigns over \"break\" and holidays.
