Pedram also has practice exams and practice quizzes from previous years which makes it much better to prepare for midterms. He also has three midterms, compared to Fawzi only having 2 midterms, so I would say it is preferable to have three less weighted midterms. This might be an unpopular opinion, but I felt Pedram's midterms were quite easy and fair, especially compared to Fawzi's. Pedram also only had quizzes every couple of weeks, compared to Fawzi having a quiz every week, on very random topics. Where Pedram falls against Fawzi is his projects and their god-awful descriptions.

As someone who has never done CS before this class, I feel like I genuinely understand everything he taught us. He explains things SO WELL, and in addition, he draws out what\u2019s happening using memory maps (if you don\u2019t know, they\u2019re basically a tool that helps you visualize what\u2019s happening behind the scenes in code) which helps you understand just so much better (from what I\u2019ve seen, Nelson does not do that). I would come into that 50 minute lecture and feel like I was only in class for 15 min. It\u2019s genuinely incredible how interesting the class was and how fast it moved. And back to the point about him being monotone, if you can\u2019t find the lecture interesting because of that, maybe re evaluate if you should even be in CS. Any subject can be made exciting with a funny professor like Nelson, but if you don\u2019t find the lectures interesting with a \u201cboring\u201d professor, the professor is not the problem. During lecture, he would give us a min or two to discuss with our neighbors and see if we understood, which was also an opportunity to go up to him and ask a question. I only ever came up to him once, and when I did, he was so excited to answer. He knows his stuff and is excited to answer your questions (but his TA\u2019s exist for answering most questions, and the TA\u2019s are good too). However if you do need to email him about excused absences, he\u2019s very prompt. As for exams, I saw another review about how they\u2019re 8-10 pages long, which is true. But the vast majority of the exam is space for you to write your code, and most of the time you don\u2019t even need 1/2 that space, they just give it in case. If you paid attention in lecture and did well on the projects, you\u2019ll do well on the exams.
