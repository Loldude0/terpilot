I can't say I learned too much in this class, though maybe I would have if I didn't have research experience already. It's a 3 credit class that feels like a 1 credit class. Overall it was a positive experience and I'm excited for FIRE moving forward. She insists that you call her by her first name (because Ruangmas is hard to pronounce I think), which is a bit weird but whatever. She also struggles to communicate sometimes, but it's always brief. You'll get a randomly assigned long term group, and while I got lucky, I know that's not guaranteed. That and the communication thing are really the only reasons she's not getting 5 stars from me, I'd give 4.5 if I could.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2022-12-04T18:26:37.358766Z"}, {"professor": "Thanicha Ruangmas", "course": "FIRE120", "review": "Great professor who will always answer questions if you ask.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2022-12-13T18:09:05.492577Z"}, {"professor": "Thanicha Ruangmas", "course": "FIRE120", "review": "Fair grading, easier than ENES140.
