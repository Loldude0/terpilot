Took Professional Writing for Science Majors with her, and I couldn't be happier with my choice. She understood that this english class was not topping our list of priorities when we all were in junior or senior-level science classes. She was okay with us coming in a little late, asking for extensions on assignments, or even missing class now and then as long as we let her know beforehand with an email. She really took the time to help anyone and everyone that she could in office hours, during class, or by scheduled appointment. \n\r\nDidn't require a textbook or any reading outside of class. The class webpage was not on ELMS, but on a casual blog that she updated before each class. Would recommend her to anyone.

You won't get much more than an easy A out of this class, so if you value your time and money choose another professor.  But if your parents pay your tuition and you're just at UMd for the sake of getting a diploma, Shea might be a good choice because she expects so little of her students.\n\r\n1) Professor Shea has a habit of bringing up different students' academic interests, asking them questions, and then cutting them off.  Or she'll use one student's research as an example and misrepresent it.  This is incredibly annoying.  (Her knowledge of science is fairly broad but remarkably shallow.)  If you really have no idea what you want to do with your life -- if you're one of those \"I want to save animals\" or \"I want to make a living by doing something outdoors\" types -- you might benefit from the fact that she knows a bunch of people in the area and tries to help students out.  But if you know who you are and what you're talking about she'll drive you insane.  Oh, and if you do research or want to put your writing to use, watch out.  She once asked a student for permission to share his paper with her next-door neighbor, and 30 seconds later she said, \"Your paper is sitting on his desk.\"  She also makes you post some preliminary assignments online on her public website.\n\r\n2) She assumes that absolutely all of her students are horrible writers so she grades assignments based on how many times you use the word \"it\" and silly things like that.  She gives virtually no feedback -- she only corrects student work in the way that a proofreader would, which is especially bad since her own website is so full of typos.\n\r\n3) Professor Shea does not use a textbook.  She has a badly organized blog.  Her blog has lots of links to things you may or may not have heard of, that may or may not actually be interesting and/or funny.  She also yells loudly during class time, when we're supposed to be writing, about whatever scientific topic she's \"exited\" about.  (She gets really excited whenever she smells the opportunity to talk about her fancy scientist friends, or tell us how to think.)  Do not expect to learn.", "rating": 2, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2012-09-10T19:30:00Z"}, {"professor": "Marybeth Shea", "course": "ENGL390", "review": "Professor Shea is great! She is VERY excited about science and makes the class a lot more fun than you'd think. This is not a hard class, as long as you do all the assignments and follow her guides. One criticism is that she sometimes wastes class time with unimportant material. Instead of going over the specifics of how to write an assignment, she'll spend the ENTIRE class period before it's due discussing argument theory. I sometimes felt that she didn't really explain certain assignments very well either. That being said, she's still very helpful and cares about improving your writing. Overall, she's a good junior English professor.

She is very reasonable with extenuating circumstances in terms of turning in assignments.

Some assignments were announce only mere days before they were due, and these were sometimes involved papers. She also often misplaces assignments. I had to hunt her down a few times because she never knew what she did with rough drafts that she had promised to hand back in class.\n\r\nRelatively easy to do well in this course, once you forget everything you know about writing well and figure out how to write exactly what Shea wants.

As a vague summary, I took Marybeth virtually, with classes MWF. However, around 1/2 -1/3 of the way through the semester, she canceled all Friday classes for asynchronous work time. You have 3 \u201cassignments\u201d throughout the semester, although each is split into multiple peer review and draft phases. \r\nPros:\r\nYou can take the class from anywhere, whether driving or sitting outside of your next class. In fact, she actively encourages it.\r\nShe does not make you participate or even turn on your camera.\r\n*Very* easy A. Easiest class I\u2019ve taken since high school, if not earlier. *Maybe* 4 hours max on this class including in class time. The assignments don\u2019t even start until halfway through the semester. They are normally incredibly light assignments as well. For example, one was to write 4 topic sentences and 3 bullets under each one.\r\nMarybeth is incredibly lenient regarding deadlines.\r\nYou really don\u2019t have to show up and/or pay attention, as she posts all information online, and does not care about absences up to a point.\r\nCons:\r\nThe online format means I have made exactly 0 connections with my peers or the teacher (not Marybeth\u2019s fault, but still lonely).\r\nThis feels like the most ridiculous waste of time in my entire life. If you already know writing basics, you will probably learn nothing the entire time. For example, we spend pretty much our entire time going over basics such as that vs which, comma vs colon vs semicolon vs period, make the verb agree with the noun, etc. Other advice seems entirely useless, such as \u201conly include three main points.\u201d Like\u2026 huh???\r\nShe is incredibly flighty, and spends most of the time talking about anything but the class. This includes, but is not limited to Pokemon cards, Austin Powers, her various health issues, mooncakes, how she talks to her doctors about her health issues, how Zoom and Canvas are \u201cstealing all our data\u201d, and her research regarding her health issues (which at least is\u2026 vaguely related).\r\nShe often treats us like 5-year olds, calls us her \u201cM&Ms\u201d or \u201cdarling kittens\u201d which she has to \u201cherd\u201d. \r\nShe basically does not use Elms, and instead uses her own website. This would be fine, if she organized it in any way that was remotely even equivalent to Elms. Everything from class (which is not only everything said in class, but lots of additional information she just never covers) is in one big webpage, with weeks in reverse chronological order, but within the week is normal chronological. One way or the other would be fine, but the mixing makes it confusing. She does often condense all of the info for assignments into a Google doc or something similar, but not always, and that still means you have to find it.\r\nHer phrasing is often confusing, and she\u2019ll put things into instructions that she never said in class, or vice versa, or sometimes conflicting information, so it\u2019s never very clear what she wants.\r\nRegarding the loose deadlines: this can be nice, but if you are someone who likes to stay on top of things, this means that peer review assignments keep getting published later and later. Initially, they were published roughly midday Saturday, but it has gotten to roughly Monday morning now (due Monday night).\r\nIn summary, take this if you want an easy class with an easy A. However, you will probably learn nothing and be incredibly frustrated with her the entire time.\r\nShe also does not really provide any feedback other than the grades, relying only on peers. This means that if you are doing something wrong, you might not find out until too late (given that she doesn't even provide any grades until after the final assignment submission).", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-12-01T19:47:02.175013Z"}, {"professor": "Marybeth Shea", "course": "ENGL390H", "review": "To be honest, I do not think scientific writing is a priority class for a lot of students, and MBS made sure to acknowledge and accommodate for that.
