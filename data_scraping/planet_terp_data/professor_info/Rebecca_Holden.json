If you're not feeling well, you can just go to class on zoom. She also hosts some movie nights where she brings dinner (the class votes on a movie). Overall she creates a welcoming environment, is easy to talk to for help, and is an easy-fair grader.\r\nCons: A lot of readings--these are accompanied by questions but they're not due until classes later, however you still have to read to at least be able to participate in the class discussion the following class. \r\nMore about assignments...\r\nEssays: They're pretty short 2-3 or 3-4 pages. One of them you got the choice to write a essay or a story + your reflection, or let AI make an essay + your reflection. She gives you enough time to complete them because you submit a draft and then do a peer review before it's due. The other essay is on a faculty interview you have to do on someone within ARHU.\r\nGroup Project: You have to lead a student-led discussion with a group\r\nFinal: You have to give a 10-12 minute presentation about a topic of your choosing related to sci-fi and class themes.\r\n\r\nMy last words, some of the assignments might be daunting but the class is really interesting and worth it even if you don't watch/read much sci-fi.
