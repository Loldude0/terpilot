I took a dance class with her for Honors Humanities. She is very passionate and knowledgeable, and in HHUM205 she brings in lots of guest dancers to keep the class interesting. She\u2019s very understanding about extensions and personal situations as well.  If you aren\u2019t very invested in the subject of dance (like me) the content can drag a little sometimes, but if you find it interesting I would absolutely recommend this class!", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2022-12-03T20:35:25.220309Z"}], "name": "Kathleen Spanos", "slug": "spanos"}
