The students being so happy that a course is over is really something.\r\ninstructor: performance beyond awful in running the course and for encouraging p-hacking. Would rate 0 stars if I could.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, this was way to much work for a 2cr 200-lv course.\r\n\r\nLack of documentation / spec doesn't help either. \r\nUsing MITM software provided by the course staff is virtually required, which wouldn't be too bad except for the fact that it's broken and lacks documentation.\r\nImportant bug fixes to it were made multiple weeks into the semester, and the entire setup relies on deprecated packages, so updating breaks it.\r\nEven after those fixes, it's still bugged.

(Marking in adherence to the rubrics, not so much)\r\nPeer reviews were used to give feedback (rather than instructional staff) for a large assignment early on, which wouldn't be an issue if the peer review comments correlated with the marks given.\r\nGrades were assigned here pretty arbitrarily, using justifications like 'this section was not 2 pages' (paraphrased) to deduct points from groups that had slightly above 2 pages as well as those with slightly below.\r\nWith margins though, no group could possibly have exactly 2 pages. \r\n\r\nEarly on, there were also marks for more subjective things like presentations, for which grades were not released until months later.\r\nThe thing is, no rubric was used in grading these -- just \"a general feel[ing]\" (direct quote). (???) This is MONTHS after the actual presentation! \r\nI barely remember what my teammates talked about, much less little details of other groups; there is no way the course staff remembers details sufficient to assign meaningful grades months later.\r\n\r\nWhen confronted about this, though, they doubled down and refused to provide grading criteria for the final presentation/paper.\r\nNow, rumor has it that Dr. Cukier was attempting (successfully?) to make the course appear \"rigorous\" by assigning low grades.\r\nI personally have no evidence of this one way or another, but consider this case:\r\n\r\nThe course staff told students that our proposals (worth about 20% of the overall grade) would be rejected and we would be asked to repeatedly revise them if they were not sufficiently well written.\r\nHowever, one entire group's proposal was accepted and subsequently scored 11.3/20 (probably 11.25 actually due to ELMS rounding) -- an F (mean was 15.3/20). \r\n\"F denotes failure to understand the subject and unsatisfactory performance.\" An unsatisfactory proposal should have been rejected, no? \r\n\r\nWhile other students undoubtedly have a long list of grievances about this course, I'll just touch on this one.\r\nHe actively encouraged p-hacking (see https://xkcd.com/882/) to groups who initially failed to reject their null hypotheses.\r\nThis included suggesting \"regrouping the data\" and even as far as \"just looking at one week [of 1-2 months worth]\" (paraphrased).\r\nThis is questionable at best, and most researchers view it as cheating in the experiment -- perhaps just shy of scientific fraud.", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "B", "created": "2018-12-13T22:53:30Z"}, {"professor": "Michel Cukier", "course": "ENME392", "review": "This is by far the worst course I\u2019ve taken at UMD.
