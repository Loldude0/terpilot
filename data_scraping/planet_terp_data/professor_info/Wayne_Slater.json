There were weekly assignments on readings which were pretty easy and a bit tedious at times, but they also really helped me with understanding the readings better. The midterm was open-note and explained very thoroughly, and Dr. Slater cancelled our final exam (I'm telling you he's genuinely the best). Dr. Slater is also a very fair and easy grader.
