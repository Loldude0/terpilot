She was super understanding of the fact that many of us were struggling with online university, plus she was definitely aware that a lot of us had to prioritize our major classes over this GenEd. We had multiple assignments get pushed back and she gave out extensions if you needed them, which was very much appreciated! That being said, this definitely isn't an easy A, you have to put the work in if you want to get a good grade.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2021-01-11T23:47:55Z"}, {"professor": "Robin Allen-Klein", "course": "ENGL390", "review": "Robin was an awesome teacher!! She only had us meet once a week on zoom, but had about 2 hours of conferences the other day for people to drop in and get help. Her grading is very fair and she will help you however she can. She was extremely considerate and dropped a bunch of assignments from the schedule because she saw students were overwhelmed with online learning. Take her class if you can!!", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2021-01-13T16:54:11Z"}, {"professor": "Robin Allen-Klein", "course": "ENGL390", "review": "Dr. Allen-Klein was awesome for ENGL390. Yes, her classes are in-person rather than online, but she makes it worth your while. She's a fair grader on writing assignments, which is a big bonus. Class was also useful most of the time, so the in-person component can actually help you with your assignments. I recommend Dr. Allen-Klein as a professor for ENGL390.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-12-10T02:45:23.051140Z"}], "name": "Robin Allen-Klein", "slug": "allen-klein"}
