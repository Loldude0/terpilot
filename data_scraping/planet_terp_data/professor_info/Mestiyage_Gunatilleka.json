I went into this class only after taking AP Stats in high school, and if you're like me I forgot pretty much everything after walking out of the exam room.

For answers that are already written in the back of the textbook, I'm pretty sure Danul is okay with you looking at them, because one day I walked into office hours to ask a question and he said \"did you refer to the answer key before coming?\" which was kind of funny. He's also a really chill guy and makes occasional jokes that keep the lectures interesting. I remember one time during the finals review lecture, he said \"and I'll be grading harshly for the final,\" and the class fell dead silent. He broke the silence soon saying that exams must have had us pretty stressed out, because obviously that was a joke.
