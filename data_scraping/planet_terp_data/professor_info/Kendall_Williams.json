The WebAssigns were more to assess and make sure you understood how to do the material, the worksheets are harder but will be more of what your midterm questions will be like, the written homeworks are kinda miscellaneous but they\u2019re important to your grade. If you put effort into this class and get help from office hours, the tutoring center in Kirwan, or just online help, then you will be fine in this class. Don\u2019t slack off on the exams.\r\nBreakdown:\r\n- Worksheets (20), 10%, they\u2019re done EXCLUSIVELY only in discussions, and you must turn it in by the end of it, otherwise you won\u2019t get points, so don\u2019t skip discussions and do your best on it. You can always talk and get help from classmates if you need to.\r\n- WebAssign (28), 12.5%, anywhere from 8-15 questions per section. These are usually due at 7:30 AM on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and usually address the content that you learned the day before when you had a lecture (Monday, Wednesday, Friday).\r\n- Written Homework (5), 15%, THESE ARE WEIGHTED PRETTY HIGH. There are only 5 of them, so take them seriously. The first 3 are on your own and you have to submit both online through ELMS/Canvas and the day it\u2019s due in discussion. HW04 and HW05 are group written homeworks that are you guys doing practice exams leading up to the final, so get with your group early.\r\n- Midterm Exams (4), 37.5%, these are all weighted equally, so don\u2019t worry about the 1st exam being weighted more than the 4th exam. He will provide you with a past practice exam for each exam, and if you want more practice exams, just email him if he has any more. As long as you study the notes and worksheets, you should be fine.\r\n- Final Exam, 25%, study a bunch of the practice exams beforehand, go to his office hours, go to your TA\u2019s office hours and you should be ok. Make sure to read the questions.\r\n\r\nProfessor: I think Kendall Williams is pretty good. Some people may say he moves slow, but that\u2019s not necessarily the case, it\u2019s just he explains every part of the example problem that he does. The examples he does in class are very well explained, any questions that you need just raise your hand and he will explain it in depth how he got there to make sure that your question is answered and that you understand it well. He doesn\u2019t post his notes so you should go to class otherwise you probably won\u2019t know how to do the material or know what\u2019s going on unless you\u2019ve already taken Calculus 1 in the past and understand it well. He emails back pretty quick, his TA\u2019s are pretty good (shoutout Jacob). Also has a sense of humor, if he doesn\u2019t get to the material in class, he will push back the due date for the WebAssign, and is very professional all around. I would always recommend him to other people.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "C+", "created": "2023-12-26T16:51:12.841776Z"}, {"professor": "Kendall Williams", "course": "MATH246", "review": "OK, everyone saying things on here that are pushing the rating to the 3-star region are being very unfair IMO.\r\n\r\nThere are no quizzes in M246 with Williams, and the discussion is basically optional so only go if you feel it is necessary (I personally found my TAs unhelpful too which was another thing but that wasn't really Williams' fault). That being said, the lectures feel very \"engineering course\"-y in the context that there is NO justification of anything being done. In DiffEq, the opportunity to explain at least some of the logical things in the course (integrating factor, method of undetermined coefficients, hamiltonian functions, greens function, etc) was there, but it felt like Williams just chose not to because there wasn't enough time and he thought people wouldn't have interest. Not only would people have interest (at least I did), I think it would've helped made some of the concepts easier to understand (since there are a lot of non-logical concepts in DiffEq like Variation of Parameters, Local Linearization, etc).\r\n\r\nIn terms of what you learn in the course though, you definitely will learn the appropriate content and he gives you enough of a basis to go out and justify some of the things he talks about in class should you feel that is necessary (like I did). Very approachable during office hours, and an overall really fun person to be around (not to mention he's super built and will talk about non-Math things as well). Cool guy overall, definitely knowledgeable... I'd definitely take Williams for M246 if you get the opportunity.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2024-01-07T04:30:29.129369Z"}, {"professor": "Kendall Williams", "course": "MATH140", "review": "He\u2019s an excellent professor for Math140.
