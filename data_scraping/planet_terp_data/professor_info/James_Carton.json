He has a passion for what he does and is quite evident in his lectures. He is easily accessible though email and is willing to help you outside of class. His coding project were difficult to understand if you didnt have a lot of background knowledge on the subject. He helps you through the projects if you ask for it. He had a midterm and a final exam. Both are worth a significant portion of your grade and they are extremely challenging. Be prepared for those things. Other than that this was an amazing course with a great professor.
