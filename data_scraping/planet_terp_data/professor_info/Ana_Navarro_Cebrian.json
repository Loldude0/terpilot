She teaches off her PowerPoints, which she uploads beforehand, making it useful if you miss class. We watch videos sometimes.\r\n\r\nShe's very receptive of questions and is very personable. She will often share stories of her experiences with patients and make the lecture more of a conversation.\r\n\r\nThe exams are multiple choice. By nature of this class being pharmacology, most of the information is memory-based (drugs, drug names, side effects, etc.), so be prepared to memorize a decent amount. \r\n\r\nMy only real complaint for this class is that grading is very slow. The exams are scantron but for some reason it took 2-3 weeks for us to receive our grades, which was annoying. There is a long-term project as well, which still hasn't been graded even though it has been a month (was due early November, is now early December). A little nerve-wracking in that sense, but overall it's an interesting and straightforward class.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "", "created": "2021-12-15T04:17:49Z"}, {"professor": "Ana Navarro Cebrian", "course": "NEUR200", "review": "her tests were very straightforward, multiple choice, always exactly what she taught us from the slides. She was extremely nice and accomodating, offered extra credit, showed us interesting videos during class time that tied into what we were learning. This class was definitely one of the least stressful classes I took fall semester, Dr. Cebrian had a lot of passion for the neuroscience subject which was really inspiring. I highly recommend you take Dr. Cebrian if you can, the only downside (which is also an upside depending on how you look at it) is that the only grades in this class are three multiple choice exams that are around 30 points each, a research project and presentation that is only 20 points and a final that is 30-40 points. This means that even getting 3 questions wrong on one of the midterms will bring you grade towards a 90% and getting 6 wrong towards an 80%, this means that it is really really important to do well on the exams because your grade is entirely comprised of midterms ,a final and the project. It was nice not having to worry about quizzes and homework so I could focus that energy on other difficult classes. Dr. Cebrian helped with this issue by providing some extra credit and also giving a lot of weight to the project relative to the exams. This was nice because the projects are designed to be fun and you get to work with a group instead of by yourself,  mostly everyone did very well on them.

Professor Navarro is a good lecturer, but her classes are long and lecture heavy. If you miss class, the power points don\u2019t give you enough information to be successful on the exams.\"\r\n\r\nRevised Note: You can easily survive with a good grade on the exams by memorizing the information on the power points. Rarely was there information that was actually outside of the powerpoints, and usually she sent out a mass email to everyone emphasizing the fact that she wants us to know it and it was not on the powerpoint. Also she doesn't make us memorize strange extraneous information or complex diagrams and it clearly flows and relates to eachother. Also the final exam was not cumulative which cut down my stress and amount of studying I had to put into it.\r\n\r\n What they said--> \"There\u2019s really no correlation between the recommended book and her PowerPoints. There\u2019s no information from her on what information is on what chapter or what chapter the module relates to.\"\r\n\r\nRevised note: This is because as she mentioned multiple times, she does not use a book. Although she has a document with links to supporting readings you could look at if you were interested, but it was not needed to understand the material. In my opintion the slides were more than enough of a resource to study with\r\n\r\nWhat they said--> \"Grades take forever, took almost two months to get grades back on the group project (a large chunk of the grade). \"\r\n\r\nRevised note: The group project (pretty much an individual project if u r worried about that), was the TA's project and therefore graded by the TA, at the TA's own leisure. It was not the prof fault that it was not graded fast, and the project was graded so leniently that I did it and turned it in the day it was due and got an A. Don't be worried about this. And we got our exam scores back immediately since it was multiple choice on elms, so that kinda evens it out.\r\n\r\nWhat they said--> \"She\u2019s very difficult to get ahold of, and can be quite rude when it comes to ADS accommodations. She will not make an effort to meet with you outside of her office hours, doesn\u2019t give out an email to reach her, and when you approach her after class to speak she just tells you to go to her office hours. \"\r\n\r\nRevised note: She has office hours and can meet outside of them, not hard to get a hold of. She is also a very kind and understanding person and from my experience I had no problem with ADS accommodations. Perhaps this person had a bad early on interaction with her in this regard and that is why they are so violently against her. She will meet with you outside of OH. Her email is literally in her syllabus, which this person must not have read. Also I have asked her questions after class and she does her best to answer, but if its a long question it may not be possible to answer it in that environment. You can just email her to ask or go to OH like you would with any other class, she is not going to mock or judge you, she is too kind for that.\r\n\r\nWhat they said--> \"Difficult class if you have health issues that cause you to miss a good amount of classes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRevised note: I got sick. A lot. and I still did very well in the class by just memorizing the slideshow presentations before the exam. It was not difficult, don't worry about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nI write this because I don't want anyone to get scared of this class, I would have her again in a heartbeat and that class was one of my favorite classes because of her.
