Tim Canty is not an engaging teacher and has his TA's sitting in the back of the classroom watching over the class and watching our every move. I find it unnecessary and excessive. This is one of the classes where he forces and drags you to class. He records his lectures and posts them online which truly is helpful and I am thankful he does that, however, by default, he encourages students to not go to class because they can view the lectures later. However, he has surprise exit cards he calls topics of the days which in turn \"scares\" or \"stresses\" students out into going into class. Also, when we have discussions, rather than reviewing material we went in class, we end up doing group projects which are supposed to support our grade. But discussion is only 50 minutes, so there isn't enough time to explain group projects and do a thorough coverage of material that was went over in class so students are put at a disadvantage. This class seems to set you up to succeed with the way he grades but if anything, it makes the class more tedious than necessary and is setting you up to actually do worse.
