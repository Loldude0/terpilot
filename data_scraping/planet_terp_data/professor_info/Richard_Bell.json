Take very organized notes, I would recommend typing them, as when he gives you the list of IDs, you can just Control-F to find them for the final.\n\r\nHe has occasional guest speakers; some a re good, others not so much, but this is a new class so I expect it will get better in that regard.\n\r\nOverall, awesome teacher, hard essays, weird grading scale (grades on like a 9 point system instead of 10), seemingly impossible final but just take good notes during the semester and it won't be too bad.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "B", "created": "2011-05-17T17:47:00Z"}, {"professor": "Richard Bell", "course": null, "review": "Professor Bell is by far the best professor I've had at Maryland.
