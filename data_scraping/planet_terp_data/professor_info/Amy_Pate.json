Professor Pate is a great lecturer, is very passionate and knowledgeable about the subject, and her seminar-based class was very informative. She clearly cared about each of her students and made sure that they understood each topic we covered. After the midterm, the class shifts into group work for the final project and we are walked through each aspect of the final project and then given inclass time to work with our groups. Would most definitely take another class with Professor Pate.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-12-28T18:51:41.125985Z"}], "name": "Amy Pate", "slug": "pate_amy"}
