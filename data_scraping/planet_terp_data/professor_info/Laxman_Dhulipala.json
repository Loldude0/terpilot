He keeps lectures interesting by relating algorithms to the history and intent of them in the past. His explanations focus on building intuition for algorithms and he answers questions thoroughly. The class is good for building general algorithms intuition which may help in other coursework. The class is a decent amount of work, the homeworks each take 6-8 hours and are quite difficult. The exams are reasonable. He is open to suggestions since he is new at teaching but he is doing a good job already.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2022-11-17T03:24:08.820648Z"}, {"professor": "Laxman Dhulipala", "course": "CMSC451", "review": "New professor from industry, but has an excellent handle on a few areas that other professors struggle with. First of which is relating abstract material to real life. He manages to do this most often by incorporating the history and intuitions from which algorithms were developed into the introduction to learning them. Second of which, he takes time to engage with the class ALL THE TIME, and will not often leave a question unanswered. If he does, he usually clears it up after class. Exceedingly responsive on Piazza and ridiculously welcoming in office hours. Prof Dhulipala is a wonderful and passionate teacher, and I urge you not to take the kindness for granted nor take advantage of it, but instead take this opportunity to learn! \r\n\r\nThe course material is rough, no doubt, but it is not for lack of teaching skill. The homeworks take a LONG time. I waited until far later in the semester than I should have to get assistance with them, so I will say this: do not push this class to the backburner to focus on other easier assignments first. I would say the best strategy would be to take some time to at least write questions you have about the homeworks at face value, early on, so you have something concrete to bring to office hours, and then go early to get guidance and intuition.

In my opinion, the coding parts were more challenging than the written part in most cases. He ended up giving a lot of extensions this semester, but hopefully in the future he will do a better job making the assignments doable in two weeks and sticking to that deadline.\r\n\r\nThe ones towards the middle of the course are the hardest, but just try all of the problems, go to office hours and don't worry about your grade.

He has a strong passion for the course material and is always looking for ways to make the course more effective in passing that passion on to students. In many ways, 451 just picks up where 351 finished, so you spend time diving deep into a lot of different algorithmic ideas and patterns in a way that really helps you to strengthen your algorithmic thinking. It's also still just a survey course of algorithms, and after finishing this course I feel like a whole world has opened up to me.\r\n\r\nThis semester we had competitive programming-style homework problems on CodeForces as well as written theory homeworks. You could pick any language you liked to implement your solutions. I really liked this way of teaching the course since it kept a strong focus on algorithm theory (very fun) but also forces you to really understand how to implement algorithms in practice.

Homeworks are quite difficult (as expected) but exams are very fair!! I would say the lectures vary in terms of speed. Sometimes he goes through material fast since there is a lot to cover and imo it was just better to listen and not take notes. (He also record lectures and uploads them!).

Ngl the homework took me at least 40 hours for each. But the TAs are super helpful, we could always ask them to verify our solutions or explain the concepts. Feel free to go to OH if you are struggling in the course.\r\n\r\nLaxman is very nice and responsive on piazza. He's a great lecturer as well. He also cares very much about his students, given that we got like 4-5 extensions on the homework.\r\n\r\nThe course wasn't easy but you'll definitely learn alot. Take it with him if possible.
