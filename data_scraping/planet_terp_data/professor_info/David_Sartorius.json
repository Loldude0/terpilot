He says on the first day that the class isn't about beaches and drinking in the Caribbean, and he means it. He can be tough, so get ready to read, but I didn't think the amount of reading was anything extra insane. He wants arguments and interpretations about history, not just facts or summary. So if you can't come up with arguments for weekly assignments, watch out. My biggest issues were some of his classroom policies. If you aren't there when he calls your name on roll but come in literally 2 seconds after, you're done. If you have food or a loud drink, you're done. If, Heaven Forbid, your phone goes off, you're REALLY done. He also hates sleepers. So you have to make the choice to either bring a drink like tea or pepsi, or sleep. Oh, and don't ask any questions, interrupt him, or dare to get up and use the restroom. He'll either be a loose cannon about stuff like that, or say nothing. But you know what he's thinking-\"that you're sooo done.\" All in all, its not easy but you can learn alot. It's a pretty good choice if you have to take a 400 class, but remember it's 400.

Excepts way too much from his students, especially during a pandemic, and can be outright rude when there are differing opinions between him and the students. He used the pandemic to justify being behind on grading, but would rarely give out any extensions or accommodations for students who had been personally impacted by COVID. There was one student who had to get an emergency surgery one week and they asked for an extension on that week's work and he responded that it would be more convenient for him if she didn't get an extension.

This is not an easy lower level history course! It was harder than one of my 300 level history classes. He is strict and does not take well to eyes on computer screens, and phone usage. He can also get flustered if there is not sufficient participation from numerous students. However, if you show up on time, go to all classes, participate and do all your assignments to the best of your abilities, there is no reason why you should not walk away having passed the course. While he was strict and had high exceptions, your writing significantly improves throughout the course.

It is true that he does not like screens, interruptions, and he can be intimidating. However, just by following a few rules like being on time and turning your phones off, the class becomes quite enjoyable. I honestly did not like history before I took this class, but now I\u2019m getting a minor in colonial Latin America. As long as I did my work, I enjoyed the professors little quips and passion to teach his favorite subject. Don\u2019t get me wrong, his class is hard and can frustrate some students, but through his office hours, and notes I believe anyone taking this class will be fine. You just need to put in the work and adapt. If you are not the student to work hard and learn from this class, I suggest you take an easier one. This class challenged my writing, reading, time management, and critical thinking skills every single time, and while it was not always fun, I believe it was worth it. I believe that he often times gets a bad rap due to his demeanor but once you get into the groove of the class, his little jokes and love of history can make the class enjoyable.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "B+", "created": "2022-12-15T04:17:39.824488Z"}, {"professor": "David Sartorius", "course": "HIST250", "review": "At the beginning of the semester, I only took this class as a \u201ceasy\u201d gen-ed without really caring at all about history.

It is true that the professor insists on being early to class, go to the bathroom before class, and have phones turned off, but is it really that difficult to follow these rules? He does have a little temper but he got better throughout the past semester. I believe that most students who don\u2019t like him came with different expectations for the class and would have preferred better communication. That\u2019s how I felt.  However, I went often to his office hours and he helped me understand and learn what I should be looking for.

I took the class in my first semester of freshman year, and I was thrilled that his teaching style combines English and history together. The class involves many hours of close reading - sometimes more than 100 pages - along with weekly mini-essays (but you do not do one every week, you choose which seven to do throughout the year). If you do the class, be prepared for lots of readings, improving your writing, including developing your own argument in everything you write, and participating in class. \r\n\r\nSartorius takes attendance and puts class participation as part of your grade. The readings in the course are argumentative essays by historians and primary sources that contradict each other. You will need to synthesize these sources together and think very critically when you write. \r\n\r\nIf you come to class and stay engaged, it is a lot of fun, but be wary of using electronic devices, which he is picky about.
