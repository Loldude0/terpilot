This course is pretty dry and dull in terms of material, so I am not sure if any other teacher would've made it more interesting for me, but Dr. Yoon certainly did not.\r\n\r\nI took this course during a summer session so it was compacted into classes every day for 6 weeks. We had one midterm exam, a home work every week and a final exam. I felt so inadequately prepared for both exams, and the homeworks were tedious busy work. On top of that he assigned a coding project in C that was a simulation of the MIPS pipeline process (You learn about this during the class) and it was the second hardest project I ever took on and I felt it was just useless busy work. \r\n\r\nThe midterm was incredibly long and ridiculously packed with material not many were familiar with. He even said he anticipated low exam scores because people would not finish on time. For the first exam, we originally had 85 minutes, however since there was no class after ours let out he extended it to 100 minutes because people needed more time. This was the same situation for the final exam only no time extension. I barely got time to go to all the questions and just attempt them. \r\n\r\nThe one thing that makes this class with Yoon worth it, is it can be a passable class since he gives a butt load of extra credit and partial credit for just attempting questions but not necessarily answering them correctly.\r\n\r\nBecause of the unreasonable amount of questions on exams, the difficulty of the project and homeworks, the average of the class was a 56%. So Yoon curved the course NICELY. I ended up with a 66% and that was good enough for a B- .\r\n\r\nI like Yoon as a person and he's very helpful in his office hours but he still isn't very clear on the material a lot of times. Since I do not know how the other teachers are for 411 I cannot suggest taking them over Yoon. If you have to take Yoon just remember these things 1) The exams are unreasonably long and nearly impossible to get an A on, but he gives a lot of partial credit for simply attempting questions. 2) The project he assigns is hard and unnecessary busy work. 3) He isn't very effective as a lecturer, and does not give enough resources and practice materials to prepare you for exams.

I see that he has taught CMSC411 in the past, which does not surprise me. Yoon likes to attack the details of memory and other minutiae of the work done in the class. This is a good thing for those who can get a conceptual grasp of the content, but for those who are just here to code, it will be considerably difficult. Many students took to watching Nelson's lectures from previous semesters after the move to online because Yoon's lecture style proved too difficult to keep up with for some without being able to ask questions as they came to mind. Taking the time to understand Yoon's lecture style did prove very useful and I felt I learned quite a bit from the course overall.\r\n\r\nYoon's exams are tricky for similar reasons. Unlike Nelson, who will usually make his exams based around high-level understanding with code, a lot of Yoon's questions felt like tricks. There was a \"catch\" of some description in almost every coding question across all three exams, which can be annoying if one detail causes you to lose many points.\r\n\r\nYoon (and moreso Shankar) unfortunately did not do the best job of transitioning to the online environment after COVID-19 began making its rounds. I think they were unprepared for the scope of what they had to transition to, and as the semester progressed both got fairly crass. I don't hold this against Yoon too much, however, because the transition was hard for everyone.\r\n\r\nOverall, I'd recommend Yoon if Nelson is not teaching the course. You can always fall back on Nelson's material if Yoon's style does not make sense to you. Be prepared for tricky exams, but if you understand the low-level implementation of many different features in C, you should be able to score at minimum a B in the course.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "A-", "created": "2020-05-16T01:22:22Z"}, {"professor": "Ilchul Yoon", "course": "CMSC216", "review": "Sometimes hard to keep up with during lectures, but he knows his stuff", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "A-", "created": "2020-05-17T20:01:59Z"}, {"professor": "Ilchul Yoon", "course": "CMSC411", "review": "I thought CMSC351 with Kruskal was the worst class at UMD, but CMSC411 with Yoon over Summer makes a close second or possibly #1.

We ended up with 4 homeworks released randomly during the semester, one of which was released the last week of class  with 3 days notice - Mean. The class project also did NOT have a release date or due date on the syllabus and it takes half the semester to get even a few points (most of the class couldn't score more than 50% on the project).

I was left with a sour taste in my mouth after 131 and 216. The common theme with all three of these experiences is that he is a subpar lecturer and his exams are hard. He very much adopts the philosophy of making exams harder than they need to be in hopes of students having a more thorough understanding of course material as a result. In 216, I completely disregarded his lectures and managed to pass the class solely through self-study of the recommended textbook. I anticipated that I would adopt a similar strategy for CMSC411, but it actually turned out to be the opposite. In 411, I learned practically all of the course material through lecture slides and their accompanying lectures. Reading the textbook isn't really necessary, but it is a useful second resource. I watched every recorded lecture and I was able to understand most of it, and it was not entirely because of the lecture slides. Yoon's lecturing was useful in understanding a lot of the complexities of computer architecture that I likely would have been lost on if I relied solely on the textbook (the textbook is far from an easy read), but the lectures were not easy to get through. The material for this course can be extremely boring at times. The project for this course is not to be taken lightly; absolutely start it as soon as possible.

Very helpful for learning subjects that are tested on exams.\r\n- Exams are typically fair (with exceptions, explained later), both content-wise and time-wise. This includes the final.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Lectures will leave you confused, bored, and with a realization that he just covered enough information for a week of most other classes in just one lecture by BLAZING through insanely content-dense slides, skipping a decent amount of them that will end up being testable\r\n- The downside of exams: they are only fair if you review every slide of every slideshow and have notes on all of them. This class will require you to go back after every single lecture and take notes on the entire slideshow that he barely went over in class, because it is all testable material. This is one of the only reasons I passed the class, and I highly recommend you do the same if you have the unfortunate luck to end up with him as a prof.\r\n- Going off the previous point, this class will require 8+ credit hours worth of work. Every project is assigned back-to-back, with exercises (essentially mini-projects that are also submitted to the submit server) assigned with overlapping deadlines to the projects. This class will essentially train you to have the mindset \"If I have free time, I work on the project\" for the entire semester. A fair number of students start giving up near the end, just doing the bare-minimum to pass the projects. I chose to put in an unnecessary amount of work to this class to complete them, and it forced me to skip most extracurriculars and free time activities that I enjoyed. Pick your poison I guess. Also students complained about this aspect of the class, and Yoon's response was essentially \"this class is challenging, deal with it\".\r\n- The quizzes. were. the. WORST. The averages were horrendous because for some reason, he has the inability to understand how to create a reasonable assignment for a 15-minute quiz. Most of the time will be spent reading his page-long small text explanations for the code writing question at the end, and by the time you've figured out what you actually have to accomplish, there's 5 minutes left. This was incredibly surprising considering there was never a time crunch for exams, but I guess his exam writing skills don't translate over to the quizzes. \r\n- As a principle, I despise professors that require students to show up. We're paying to be here, it should be on us to go to class. I skipped discussions because my TA was incredibly useless, typically mumbling to himself the entire time as if he's never interacted with another human being in his entire life. Near the end of the semester, Yoon decided to grade (as put by another review on here) \"nothing\" assignments at every discussion. Typically, it was a small worksheet that would take about 15 minutes that would cause us to leave incredibly early anyways. Complete waste of me and every other students' time that would have been better spent working on the projects. \r\n\r\nOverall, avoid him. Definitely a passable class, just be prepared to put in WAY more time into the projects, exercises, and studying than you're used to from 131 and 132. The only reason he gets 2 stars instead of 1 for me is a) he's completely oblivious to the way his course design tortures students outside of class and b) the exams are pretty fair. Best advice: review all the slides and take notes outside of class, and START PROJECTS EARLY. I don't mean just early, like the literal hour they are assigned.

No, those quizzes needed at least 25 minutes, and they were always tricky for no reason. \r\n\r\nThird, he gave us zero time for our projects and exercises. We had due dates one after the other, nonstop. We would have a project due date, followed by a quiz the next day, followed by an exercise due date.

He probably expected his students would prioritize a CS project over their religion.\r\n\r\nApart from all of this, there's also the fact that he's a terrible lecturer. He used the tiny ESJ whiteboards in a giant lecture hall on multiple occasions. I was sitting in the middle and I could barely see what he was writing.

I'm giving him 3 stars because he is a genuinely nice teacher who wants to help you (especially if you go to his office hours). I also noticed that progressively through the semester, he made his incredibly difficult quizzes slightly easier, learning from student's complaints. Quiz 1 and 2 were incredibly difficult, but the last few quizzes were arguably easier than the other professor's quizzes and were a bit fairer. He started off writing some content on an incredibly small white board, but listened to student complaints and shifted to projecting onto the large screen. His practice questions were also pretty good practice for his exams, despite what some people might say below. You just have to study ALL practice tests, not just one, to have the best chances. At the end of the day, he is a caring professor so I'll give him that. BUT, his lectures lack a lot and it is very hard to follow him sometimes. You have to be prepared to put in a lot of extra work and try your hardest in this class. It has to be your top priority if you want to get an A or B. That being said, here are some tips for this class: \r\n\r\n1. Always try to start studying for quizzes and exams A WEEK before (Every quiz and exam MC or Short Answer may have tiny details that will be found from the large amount of slides that are posted on Elms). You NEED to go back to each and every slide and try your best to understand and remember what it said on each slide. You will not get away with two days of studying unless you absorb every lecture well, which is not likely to happen.\r\n2. CODING EXAMPLES and PROJECTS. The coding examples that are done during lecture or labs are insanely helpful and amazing practice for coding questions on quizzes and exams. Some coding examples or project codes are very close to what you will see on this examinations. If you practice the codes from your projects/exercises and lecture examples, you will do fairly well in coding questions. \r\n3. Go through every year of Practice exams provided. Before midterms we were given practice exams from multiple years. Focus most of your energy on the coding practice for this exams, but short answer and MC are great too because if you are lucky, they may reuse some former questions. \r\n4. START PROJECTS ON THE SECOND OR THIRD DAY (or first day if you really want). We are college students and sometimes we have better/more important things to do than starting projects and finishing them quickly. But, some of the projects released for this class have very difficult public tests and even harder release tests. The good thing is that they enforced an early deadline for the first two public tests for each project and usually if you passed the first two tests, you might pass almost all the other tests. Using this early deadline to your advantage is crucial because if you pass all public tests at the first deadline, you will have more time for release tests and office hour help. DON'T make the mistake of starting release tests very close to the final deadline because you won't get much help from the TA's who will have their office hour schedule filled up from other students. \r\n5. Rewatch Yoon's lecture videos after reading his lecture slides. This was a big one for me since I learn better by reading content and then listening. Yoon's lectures are very hard to follow in person (for many people) and I often zone out in his classes, absorbing nothing. This is what causes many people do perform poorly in this class. They don't go back and rewatch the lectures which can actually be great supplements to the lecture slides (which I'm guessing is most people's only resource for content studying). Now, I'll admit that I did not rewatch every single lecture because I did not have time, but for concepts you are very confused in, I recommend it because Yoon does have some good info in lecture if you actually pay attention or look back. \r\n6. BE PREPARED TO SELF-TEACH AND HAVE DISCIPLINE: You need dedication in this class and you need to actually care about it to do decent in the class. You need to set schedules for yourself to code up the projects and you need to try to make some attempts to attend discussions because some can be very helpful. During the Assembly and Processes unit of 216, it was mandatory to attend discussion. Many students were not happy about that but I think it fared well for them in the end. Those concepts would be incredibly difficult to understand by just reading the lecture slides and I'm sure many students would have failed those portions on the Final if they were not forced to attend discussion. In my honest opinion, discussion was very helpful during the last couple months when they made it mandatory (it was a bit \"useless\" earlier which is why many skipped).\r\n\r\n\r\nAll in all, if you care about this class and prioritize it, you can most definitely get at least a B (especially with the curve at the end).", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-01-18T20:32:46.830298Z"}, {"professor": "Ilchul Yoon", "course": "CMSC216", "review": "Don't take this professor at all. terrible. only take as a last resort. basically, ur grade depends on the curves and all u can do is pray and hope you pass or you dont", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "", "created": "2023-01-22T02:59:02.578107Z"}, {"professor": "Ilchul Yoon", "course": "CMSC216", "review": "Not an awful person.

He's overqualified for his job and makes assumptions about what we already know, so most of my time spent in lecture is spent playing catch up instead of following along with what he is actually trying to teach. That said GO TO LECTURE and GO TO DISCUSSION. It sucks, I know, but if you can do your best to try to follow along you will be miles ahead of everyone else.\r\n- He speaks with a thick accent and uses a grammatical structure (Korean) that impedes understanding. Without trying to sound racist, he just speaks in a very confusing way.\r\n- Exams are very long - difficult, but time will be your biggest issue. Considering the test average for my class is 62, you should focus on completing every problem rather than making sure every problem is correct, so you can get saved by some partial credit. Most of my friends have left full pages blank on exams.\r\n- Take the projects seriously. If you care about being a good programmer that is literally all that is important. Don't cheat on them, or if you do at least make sure you understand what you are copying. Without this I guarantee you will fail tests.\r\n- TAs take upwards of a month to grade tests and projects. On this day of writing (12/14) there are projects from 11/16 and lab activities from 11/15 that are still ungraded. Our second midterm took a full 4 weeks to get back.\r\n- Try to build a relationship with him by asking him questions after class or going to his office hours. I was able to do that and got a late assignment excused simply by asking. \r\n- For the first 2 midterms, review EVERY SINGLE example given in lab.

However, not making sure you understand the material will likely just force you to catch up during later lectures or projects, and in my experience just made the class much harder\r\n\r\nProjects and exercises are honestly (somewhat) fair but they take many, many hours (don't do them last minute). While yes, the MCQ for tests is kinda rough, I honestly think the free response isn't too bad given it's much easier to get partial credit; however, I think in order to FRQ you really need to get acquainted with your labs and the examples given in class. I often threw on many MCQ questions, but free response helped pad my grade. \r\n\r\nFinally, there are some point buffers that made the class (mildly) more bearable, mainly in the graded lab work that was introduced in the middle of the semester. I'm not sure if Yoon had this in previous semesters, but it gave a 15+% buffer of free points that really helped improve grades. \r\n\r\nI think this class overall isn't totally unfair if you can put a lot of time in (besides the test MCQs), but you really need to be prepared to spend hours upon hours each week.", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-12-25T04:26:45.511983Z"}, {"professor": "Ilchul Yoon", "course": "CMSC216", "review": "He is a great lecturer and he also records his lectures. I do agree that his exams could be on the more difficult side but he doesn't test on anything that he hasn't taught. It's just very detailed based on where a lot of the MC questions are specific. Besides this, I think Yoon is a great professor. He really does care for his students and answers your questions in depth.
