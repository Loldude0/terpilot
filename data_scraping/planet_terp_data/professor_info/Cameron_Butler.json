He actually cares about you as a student and that you're learning. He's really funny and makes the content engaging. He recognizes that we have a lot to do and adjusts assignments to make life easier for us.  Cam is so understanding. He also almost always ends class 15 minutes early if not more. I would take any class he taught. ", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2019-12-05T17:46:19Z"}], "name": "Cameron Butler", "slug": "butler_cameron"}
