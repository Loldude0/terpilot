I didnt attend lecture or any review sessions after around the first month, but I did attend each discussion section since it is basically required for the quizzes.

His goal is, regardless of your prior views on a given subject, to make you question those beliefs, and he does a pretty good job. The philosophers and their arguments are very thought-provoking. He spends a lot of time sort of getting side-tracked by some of the more outspoken students, but these tangents are, if not productive, generally entertaining. He very generously posts his slideshows, which were very helpful in preparing for the exams - the best thing you can do to prepare is attend the lecture right before a test because he goes over what kinds of questions will be covered in pretty great detail. One important thing to understand is that, as he puts it, you are not supposed to be editorializing your own ideas on the tests. You are \"manifesting competency of the subject.\" Basically, you are proving you know the arguments from the material (he's not terribly concerned with memorizing who said what, just what the arguments are and how to interpret them).\r\n\r\nAs for the class structure, it's 30% quizzes (10 three-point quizzes in the weekly discussion sections, so you do need to attend these to get the quiz prompts), 20% each for two midterms, and 30% for the final. There is no homework, and no graded work in the lectures, which are not mandatory. Exam grading can depend on who gets it; for me, my TA seemed harsher than Blair. Our averages were 85% for the first midterm and 89% for both the second midterm and final. Blair and the TAs note who participates and give a small boost to this group (basically if Blair knows your name or the TAs remember you participating in discussion you'll get this).

He rambles and beats around the bush in class in a way which makes it extremely hard to understand what the main points hes trying to make about certain arguments are. He never once clearly stated the premises and conclusion of an argument. This made the class extremely hard as basically your entire grade is based off of being able to regurgitate these arguments from different philosophers.
