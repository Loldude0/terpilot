Her teaching style is somewhat old school, lecture-based with room for questions. Just the way this sort of history should be taught. If you're not a fan of lectures, don't dispair. Because she has such a comprehensive understanding of the material, class is both engaging and (quite often) amusing. She's not the world's fastest grader, a fact which she herself admits, but she's very fair. She's also flexible with students regarding paper deadlines, exam dates, etc. If you're looking for a solid history class that will provide you with a wealth of knowledge and is taught by a genuinely wonderful person, take as many classes with Dr. Baron as possible.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2011-05-06T16:40:00Z"}, {"professor": "Sabrina Baron", "course": "HIST235", "review": "She is an interesting teacher and is really nice.  You get two five page essay assignments and two exams.  The essays are analytical reviews on a primary and a secondary source.  Take these paper to the writing center because she doesn't like grammatical errors.  \n\r\nHer tests are kind of hard because she picks random 25 words and you have to write why they are important in historical times or something like that.  She wasn't really specific on what she wanted on the test, so a lot of people didn't do so well.  But she gave us a generous curve.  She is really a slow grader, she went over our midterm on the last class.  \n\r\nAlso, you have to go to class, take notes, and talk in class to get a good participation grade.

However, her class style is a bit annoying. It is very straightforward yet not very focused on techniques to improve your grade.

We had to write two 5 page papers during the semester, but I only know my grade on one.

I wouldn't even buy the books unless you want to read them for yourself. She goes over all of the material in class that you need to know. Her exams are ID questions so they really aren't very challenging and she doesn't try to trick you. She is also very helpful in office hours so I recommend taking advantage of that too.
