Most of the work in this class is labor-based, so you'll get an A if you put in the effort to do it. Participating is key to this class, however, and expect to speak in class at least once or twice each week. The majority of your grade is the Changemaker Challenge: consisting of three phases of challenges where you try and make change on your community. This was harder than expected - start early if you want to succeed. Weekly readings were interesting, but sometimes really long - and having to summarize them was definitely the most busy work I've done in a while for a class.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-12-26T03:31:55.866856Z"}], "name": "James Stillwell", "slug": "stillwell"}
