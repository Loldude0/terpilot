You can tell he really cares about his students and tries to inspire passion when he can. He goes out of his way to organize field trips and make sure students get outside and hands-on. The one major field trip he plans is organized through Biohabitats, a prominent ecosystem restoration company in the region, in which students have the opportunity to ask as many questions as they want to their Senior Ecologist, Joe Berg. Professor Baldwin himself is funny and compassionate. He allows students to turn in assignments late for full credit and all of his quizzes are take-home and open note. It's an easy, yet fulfilling and informative course, that I would highly recommend.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-05-14T20:02:58.391628Z"}], "name": "Andrew Baldwin", "slug": "baldwin_andrew"}
