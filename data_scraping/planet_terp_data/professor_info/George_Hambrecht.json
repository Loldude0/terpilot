There was a point in the semester when I forgot I was even taking this class. It consisted of five 10-minute reading quizzes and then just 2 projects towards the end. Communication was bad since he barely emailed back and would skip over things in the syllabus. Half the time he never uploaded any lectures. He never even made any real contact with the class until we were 2 weeks into the semester. Throughout the semester it was super easy with barely any work and then at the end there are two big projects that determine your grade.

Dr. Hambrecht is a really chill professor who wants people to succeed in the class, which was also great.

A little spacey, clearly doing a lot, but he is understanding and willing to work with you. Do not expect responses to emails, but still send them because he will immediately forget whatever you talked to him about otherwise. \r\n240 is not a class he normally teaches. Take-home quizzes make up the majority of your grade. There are big projects near the end of the semester but you get a LOT of time. \r\nThe subject matter can be pretty boring if it's not your passion, but if you're in to prehistoric human burials it's an interesting class.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "B", "created": "2023-12-04T20:47:26.151627Z"}, {"professor": "George Hambrecht", "course": "ANTH240", "review": "Dr. Hambrecht is a really good professor.  He genuinely cares about his students\u2019 learning and adjusts his assignments accordingly.

I had this class at 9:30 and the slides were posted on ELMS but I still got up and went to class because his lectures were so interesting (at least to me). There were about 5 quizzes the entire semester which were pretty straightforward and easy since they are take home and open note. He assigned a textbook for us to read but I think if you attend lectures you can get away with not using the textbook. There were two other assignments besides the quizzes: a project where you compare two archaeology articles and the final exam. The final exam was 3 two page essays which I was not expecting. I figured it would be a cumulative exam but he announced that it was essays on the last day of class. I'm not complaining though because how easy the rest of the semester was cancels out the time spent writing those essays.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-12-19T19:02:20.133812Z"}, {"professor": "George Hambrecht", "course": "ANTH240", "review": "I expected this class to be easy and interesting but it was neither.
