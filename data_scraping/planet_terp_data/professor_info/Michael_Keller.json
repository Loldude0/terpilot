His lectures were probably only good before the 1st exam and then it went downhill. The Wednesday activities were sometimes just a waste of time, but sometimes they were good. It annoys me that he doesn't do + or - grading, which just sucks when you try to hard to get an A and if you are a point or two off, he will not curve or bump you up to get an A. Your grade really depends on the TA and whether or not they grade harshly in lab. Lab is basically a way to get most points unless your TA is just rude. I don't know, Keller was a nice person in general, but he has certain teaching practices that were just not considerate---like no plus or minus grading and Wednesday activities (which include clicker quizzes) that really contribute to getting a lower grade than you rightfully deserve. However, he does offer a couple of extra credit opportunities--usually only a point or two here and there, though.

Totally not fair because we were not able to choose which one we were in, and as a result, our grades suffered. Yes, he did curve in the end to make up for it, but the added stress and extra assignments we were given probably impacted the time and effort we were able to put into our other classes.\r\nHe was pretty nice about office hours and make up points and stuff, but other times he was pretty snarky and sassy. \r\nWish I took this with a different professor. \r\nDefinitely possible to get an A.
