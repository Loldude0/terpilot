This class BOILS MY BLOOD every day. I am seriously considering taking a W just so I can take it with someone else. Easily the WORST professor I have had at UMD by far. \r\nHe will project a full slide of text and then just pause and make you take notes by WALKING AROUND AND CHECKING YOU LAPTOP SCREEN or else he will call you out for not taking notes. He will make you SIGN IN AND OUT of class every day and if you don't legibly put your name you won't get participation credit. He will take PERSONAL OFFENSE if you try to take a picture of the wall of text he has on the projector and CALL YOU OUT in front of the class every time you try it. He suddenly decided he wants to have a pop EXAM in an ENGLISH CLASS. Like what??? You will get no participation credit if you listen to music during class, use your phone, or don't pay attention. Literally would rather take the 10% grade hit to skip class than show up to HIGH SCHOOL again. \r\n\r\nIf you break the rules: (Copied from his Google Slide)\r\n\"Failure to comply with the above (and in the syllabus) classroom expectations will warrant a removal from the class that day.\r\nRepeated offenses will result in escalation.\"\r\n(The \"above\" he references is taking pictures of slides, having headphones in, or being on your phone)\r\n\r\nHe has no idea how to use ELMs (in his defense he is a new professor) and you will be eternally confused and have no idea what is due and when. This class gives me more anxiety than my major classes. He comes up with all sorts of assignments where the requirements are poorly documented or just plain wrong. \r\n\r\nOnly saving grace is so far he basically gives everyone 100% on stuff.

I seriously think he should pursue a different career bc it feels like he HATES teaching. \r\nHe came to the first day of class about 30 min late. This wasn't the only time he was late for class. He once said the only way late work will be excused is if you're in a coffin or if you're in a hospital bed. He once gave us what felt like a pop midterm where it was 3 pages front and back and handwritten. We had 30 min to do the MIDTERM. For the last 10 min, he goes ' I don't wanna be an asshole so you can use notes ' as if that was a saving grace. He would constantly talk about how he gets paid at the end of the week so he doesn't give a fuck. \r\nI really hope he quits or gets fired because I don't think he himself OR his students want him to be a professor.", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "", "created": "2023-03-06T17:43:30.239227Z"}, {"professor": "Robert Harris", "course": "ENGL101", "review": "The worst teacher.

Good luck learning anything from his \"death by powerpoint\" presentations and all-caps tirades either. DO NOT TAKE HIM.

Also, he has canceled class an hour before it begins multiple times, making it seem like he doesn't care about the class-- or our time-- at all. He also refused to let me make-up an assignment when I was sick, and I know I'm not the only one. Additionally, he'll walk through the aisles of students to make sure your computer screens are relevant to the course at hand... Which again, really feels like high school. And then there's his grading criteria, which is rarely clear, and often asks you to repeat yourself in different parts of the assignment. It's anyone's guess when the assignments are actually due, as the due dates change every class (though this might have been him trying to be nice?).

I was in his once a week section and while listening to him in class, it seems like there is nothing about him that makes him qualified to teach a classroom of college students. All he does is enforce deadlines and treat us like he deserves all the respect in the world. He would always walk up and down the aisle right next to me to make sure everyone was taking notes. If you weren't paying attention and taking notes, he would point it out to you in front of the whole class. On top of this, he would have us do things like sign in and out of class, pick people to read slides out loud, and even went so far as to have an exam for an English class (which he didn't tell us about). I'm almost certain that the \"exam\" (which was more of a quiz) was just an excuse to make sure people pay attention from that point on. Another thing is that there were no late deadlines on canvas, so you couldn't submit any assignment late without having to ask him. Even then he would only allow you to do this once and still penalize you. For assignments like first drafts, if you missed the deadline you would get a zero on the peer review as well. He has told us many times that he didn't care if something has gone wrong on our end that made us unable to submit on time and how we were just being irresponsible and lazy, despite him admitting that he doesn't want to grade our assignments because he's lazy.
