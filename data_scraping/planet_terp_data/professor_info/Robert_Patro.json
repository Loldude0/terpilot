The projects are well-designed and challenging without being made artificially difficult through secret tests or other quirks, and they greatly help in understanding key parts of the course content. The exams are fair and thought-provoking, with algorithm design problems that students can be reasonably expected to know how to solve. (The exam review problems and topics are very reflective of the real deal, which is very helpful.) Finally, the teacher himself is great! He is able to answer any question posed to him in class or on Piazza and clearly has a great deal of passion and subject knowledge.

Never in my years at UMD with multiple CS upper levels taken did I get a prof so out of touch with what students can do. He played the victim when half the class got a 50% on project 1, and sent a huge email to the whole class blaming students for \"being unprepared\" and that they \"asked for too much help on the project.\" This is an INTRO to bioinformatics class, why would you expect students to not struggle, they have no background on this material!?  In 2020 when he taught for the first time at UMD, he gave two projects. Suddenly for 2021 (his second time), he thought SIX would be acceptable. Ended up \"only\" doing five, and projects easily took 20-50 hours a week and you only get two weeks to do them when you should get a month for the level (because you have to write everything from scratch, he gives NO skeleton code and it's implementing ridiculous data structures and algorithms that he is only theoretical about and shows hardly any code for in lectures.) He passive aggressively ignores Piazza posts on days the projects are due and emails from students asking for appointments (his syllabus says that he is available for that, which is a lie.) His two midterms exams are impossible, averages were both a D, exam 2 a D-, all he had to say was \"but I wanted it to be a B.\" Again, not understanding his expectations are ridiculous for what undergrad students can handle. The TAs he had were two graduate students with one hour each of office hours a week, so don't even try asking them for help. They do not know anything about the class either because they haven't taken it and don't care to learn it to the depth the professor expects.

First of all, he is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about algorithms/bioinformatics(as evidently seen by his research background and his lectures), but even more than that, he has the unique talent of conveying even the most difficult material in a way that is very easy to digest while not watering down the material. Moreover, during my years at UMD, I have not come across a professor that has been as responsive during OH and piazza as Prof. Patro - even during late hours/weekends/hours before exams and project deadlines. His piazza posts in particular are godsend - extremely detailed and posted in a timely manner. Course policies are very straightforward and made very clear for everyone, and even with the constraints of having only 2 other additional TAs for a 90+ student class, the course is very well run and provides a good primer into the vast area of bioinformatics and computational biology, especially on algorithms related to fully-text indexing, sequence alignment, genome/transcript assembly, and basic phylogenomics.\r\n\r\nMake no mistake, the course material is fairly challenging(obviously since it's 400-level algorithms course) and does require a fair amount of work/effort, especially on a personal basis after lectures, to really understand and gain intuition for the algorithms and data structures covered over the semester. Your grade is entirely based on the level of effort and interest you put into the course - by starting projects early, going to OH's, actively attending lecture, I promise you a good grade will follow. Furthermore, the knowledge gained is invaluable for algorithms and bionfo enthusiasts and can help provide an entrypoint to a rewarding research career.\r\n\r\nOverall, over my years at UMD CS, he is easily the best professor I've had the pleasure of learning from.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2021-12-26T16:45:03Z"}, {"professor": "Robert Patro", "course": "CMSC423", "review": "This is by far the worst class I've ever taken. As a senior, that's definitely saying something. Patro seems really passionate about the subject and is usually pretty responsive on Piazza, but that's pretty much where any praise for this class ends. He obviously puts a lot of work into creating lectures and slides, but the issue is that they are so complicated that a lot of students have trouble understanding the material and end up having to spend a ton of time outside of class to learn it. The course is focused on teaching a lot of different algorithms that are relevant to bioinformatics, but weirdly most of the time he doesn't actually show how they work with examples, so it can be confusing. Also, much less important but the lectures are usually very dry/boring in my opinion.\r\n\r\nProjects:\r\nThere isn't any homework for this class, only projects. He planned to give us 6 projects throughout the semester, but only ended up giving us 4 mandatory projects and a 5th extra credit project because students struggled so much on projects that he was very reluctantly forced to extend the deadlines of 2 projects. For example, the average on the first project was a 50%. It's worth pointing out that he seems out of touch with how difficult these projects are since he seemed confused by how low the average on this project was and the projects only got harder from there. His projects are also graded in a weird way where it can be pretty hard to get partial credit (hence a lot of people getting 0s on them). When he releases a project, you usually have exactly 2 weeks to complete it. Normally, this would be plenty of time to do it. However, he makes his projects extremely difficult and they take like 35+ hours to finish. Since most students at this level are taking 3-5 other classes, most of which are probably upper level classes, this is a crazy amount of work.\r\n\r\nExams:\r\nThis class has 2 midterms and a final exam. The averages on both midterms were Ds. He showed us the grade distribution for midterm 2 and according to that about 38% failed it. He gave a few practice questions before both midterm exams, but honestly they were so much easier than the actual exams that it wasn't helpful. He and the TAs didn't host any review sessions although they were requested multiple times. Personally, I found a bunch of his exam questions pretty unreasonable. From what I could tell, most students found his exams difficult.\r\n\r\nI heard a lot of good things about CMSC 423 with Pop. I regretted taking this class (with Patro instead of Pop) a couple weeks after the schedule adjustment period ended when I saw what the class would really be like. Apparently, a bunch of students felt the same way because even though we started with about 93-95 students, by the end of the semester there were only 75 of us left. It seemed like a lot of people took a W to get out of the class, which is pretty telling of how rough it is... I would take notice of how only those who got very high grades in his class are giving him good rankings.

Some of the material is genuinely difficulty, but the professor is willing to explain it multiple times and in different ways, and to expand things and answer questions during office hours and on Piazza.  Some reviews on here complain about the workload, but if you're taking a 400 level CS class at UMD and you can't put together an algorithm covered in the class or figure out how to compile a program from the command line, you're gonna have a bad time. Personally, I thought the projects required effort but were totally fair.\r\n\r\nThe material was super interesting, and we learned about data structures that have runtimes I wouldn't have even though were possible before I took this class. What I learned about dynamic programming alone was worth it. The exams definitely made you think, but were fair \u2014 they tested your knowledge of the data structures and algorithms we learned by asking you to use them to solve problems that would be very difficult otherwise.  The averages on the exams were on the low end, but there was a huge curve and the professor was very clear about this up front.  Also, there was a ton of extra credit offered.  Overall, I loved this class. If you're looking for an easy, low-effort 400 level class, don't take this!

However, I very quickly found out I was wrong. The lectures are dense and the programming projects are hard. The projects are worth 50% of your grade and you have to write everything from scratch and I mean everything (like src files with a bash script submitted as a tarball). As a side note, when writing programming projects for this class, the M space for your algorithm matters a lot! I know on Leet code or other platforms most people focus on conserving N time, but in this class you really have to think about the cost of instantiating a new string in your algorithm which could result in 20+ minutes of auto grader testing time to end up with a zero. Regardless, although this class was difficult I did enjoy it a lot. It really shows you a side of cs that can actually help people and can provide valuable information to scientists across multiple disciplines like biology to help prevent diseases like cancer or sickle cell anemia. This was refreshing to me as it provided a bit more meaning to my degree rather than trying to get a job at a large tech firm and make that bank. So, if that is your goal I'd recommend taking classes like databases or machine learning to boost your resume to employers. As a professor, Rob was fantastic. He was very enthusiastic about what he teaches (which was refreshing for a change) and was very knowledgeable on the subject matter and open to helping students, extending deadlines, etc. I remember he literally held office hours on his phone for me in a hotel room to help debug my code which was awesome and I don't think any professors in my other classes, regardless of cs classes would do the same. Also, he's very up front about curving the class and tries to keep the average around a B, so if your grade suffers the first half of the semester don't give up! The only reason I rate this course as a 4 and not a 5 is that I felt the course was managed a bit poorly with 1 T.A. who tries her best with students, but when students can write in either Java, C++, Rust, or any acceptable compiled language it makes her job very hard.

Stopped showing up to class halfway through because im a lazy shit (I stopped attending pretty much all my other classes too). lectures were recorded but at terrible quality so showing up to class is definitely better. Either way, I still learned a lot. The exams were not easy but their difficulty is overstated. There is usually one question that is an extension of a concept taken from class, making it harder, but the rest of the exam content can be very simply and easily answered with exact information from the lecture, or from something you coded already in a project. The projects were not easy, but they were also not unreasonable. It took me maybe an average of 8-9 hours per project and I got 100% on all of them. You have two to two and a half weeks per project and unlimited submissions. The feedback they coded into gradescope generally lets you know what you did wrong and its not too hard to fix it based on the feedback. Dr Patro is a nice dude, gives generous curves, usually responds well to piazza posts, and even gave an extra credit project that was optional and added post curve and worth a lot of points. Admittedly, the lecture is hard to follow at times but I think that is due to the content covered and not due to Dr. Patro. If you're afraid to ask questions in class, you may fail to understand something and become confused. I think that most of the 1 stars here are just due to the content being hard, and people coping with the fact that they didnt do as good as they are used to doing with the same amount of effort.
