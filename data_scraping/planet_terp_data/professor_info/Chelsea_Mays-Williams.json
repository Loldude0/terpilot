Chapter quizzes are pretty easy as long as you can find it in the textbook, speech reflections should take no longer than 15 minutes to complete, and impromptu speeches are kind of like pop up speeches on the fly, but are really easy. Just talk about something that you like about for 1 \u00bd - 2 minutes and you will get points.\r\n- Final, 5%, this is really easy.
