Enough said. Though the content is interesting, the class  can be a bit boring as times because he lectures for an hour and 15 almost every single time. There's only a handful of assignments: weekly discussion posts (very easy), a group project (pretty easy, all groups got the same grade of 237.5/250 which is weird), a midterm (which was kinda hard, there's a couple quizlets out there to help you as well as the lecture slides, but the class average was around an 85), a group simulation (very easy), and a memo (quite difficult and graded harshly). Overall, not a bad class.
