She has a weird grading scale which only allows you to get an A, B, C, D, or F in the class (no plus or minus). She is an extremely tough grader, and at times it seems like she is just making things up. There is never a strong rubric and she does not provide feedback in comments so you must explicitly seek it out. Final paper will usually drop you a letter grade. Will not give you above a 90 if you mess up formatting on your papers (this includes missing a singular space between lines). But she is very nice and approachable!
