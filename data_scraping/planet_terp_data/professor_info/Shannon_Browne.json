I don't know about her other classes but in ENST214 we didn't even have a final. Instead, we had a couple of bigger projects but they are straightforward. They take time and lots of work but Shannon provides a lot of feedback and you can resubmit an assignment for a regrade after reading her notes. SHe can get preoccupied with everything she has going on but makes up for it with patience. Very kind and considerate lady. Easy to get a good grade if you listen to her guidance and feedback. She also provided extra credit opportunities. 20/10 would recommend. ", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2021-04-22T16:23:57Z"}], "name": "Shannon Browne", "slug": "browne_shannon"}
