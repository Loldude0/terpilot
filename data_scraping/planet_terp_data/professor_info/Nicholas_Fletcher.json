With three classes per week, generally two of them are lectures and the other is a Group Active Engagement Session (GAE) that allows you to work with classmates on a worksheet, which is graded for completion. It's a great way to make a big class feel smaller. Before the GAEs, you have to do prep work and then take a quiz, which you only get one try on.\r\n\r\nAfter every class, you have a 1 point concept check to take, which is usually 3-5 questions, and you have three tries to get 100%. These are also easy ways to get points since you can go look back at the lecture slides and your notes.\r\n\r\nDr. Fletcher also assigns homework approximately every two weeks that are graded on effort. They're usually not too hard. \r\nIn regards to all of the assignments listed above, some of your worst scores get dropped since there are so many of them. So hypothetically, you could not do some of them and be completely fine since they'd be dropped.\r\nThe exams are not too too hard if you study, but if you don't, I can bet they're difficult. This class builds off a lot of previous bio classes, so having prior knowledge can help you out a lot. Dr. Fletcher allows you to bring an equation sheet that serves as a cheat sheet that you can write on for every exam. Then, he drops your worst exam grade out of three. The only bad thing about this is that I don't think there's a curve at the end of the class since one gets dropped and the class average is a C on most exams. So, you really just need to study and get good exam grades to get an overall good grade in the class because you can't rely on a curve. \r\nThe main reason I give Dr. Fletcher 4 stars instead of 5 is because I think his lectures can get a little boring. Some of the content of this class is interesting, and Dr. Fletcher's passion does make it more interesting, but some lectures are just really hard to sit through when it's just him talking.

The assignments were weekly quizzes, daily clicker questions, a term paper about your family history, 3 midterms, and an optional final. \r\n\r\nThe midterms are mainly application based while relying on examples instead of memorization. At a minimum, you should start studying at least 3 days before the exam to make sure you are getting a well-rounded understanding of the material and have any chances to ask questions about the study guides they post with each exam.

I find his exams to be extremely in-line with what we learned and there is never anything unfair or surprising on them. I wish he taught more biology classes because I would take any class he teaches.

The only negative I can come up with is that he can rush through the slides sometimes, but everything else about the course is well done. You are typically given concept checks and group activity quizzes that are in place to help boost your grade and understand the material. The concept checks went over what we learned in lecture slides, and the group activity quizzes would help you prepare for the group activity worksheets. These worksheets helped to understand the material and were some more grade boosters. His tests were fair, and some of the questions in the review guide would be on the test. He also records his lectures, so if you miss a class or want to review material you can watch them. He would also drop the lowest midterm, so only two midterms will impact your overall grade at the end.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A-", "created": "2023-05-25T14:44:10.020162Z"}, {"professor": "Nicholas Fletcher", "course": "BSCI370", "review": "Easy money per usual.

He records almost all of his lectures so going to class is optional except for about once a week where he has group activities to reinforce content. The group activities are relatively easy and reinforce topics. After each lecture and before each group activity you will have a short quiz these are easy and great to check your understanding. For the ones post-lecture you get three attempts while for the group activity ones you only get one. I found his exams to be difficult and very detailed oriented despite everything coming off his slides. There are 3 midterms and a final. He drops your lowest midterm. A lot of this is memory based and I wish I had started reviewing material earlier in the unit because I would have done better. The final was really difficult but manageable. It's just a lot of information and content to cover.

A good person, fair grades (lowest midterm is dropped!), extra credit, and reasonable workload are all things you get with him.

For the workload, he assigns a short concept check after every lecture, the classes with the group activity have some prep material involved, and there are usually 2-3 homework assignments per midterm, but that's it. For studying, Dr. Fletcher posts an exam guide before every exam that includes some practice exam questions that might even appear on the actual exam. He also allows you to write notes on your equation sheet to use as a reference on the exams. Thank you so much Dr. Fletcher for allowing the reference sheet because there is just so much content covered in BSCI207, I wouldn't even know where to begin studying for it. The exams themselves aren't that hard and they accurately reflect the lecture and GAE material, but there's just a lot of material you have to remember. He also records his lectures which is extremely convenient for note-taking considering the amount of content in this course. The only real downside I can think of is that the final exam is worth more than 1/3 of the final grade, so you really have to study for it.
