However, I believe this to be the fault of the class, not the instructor.  Her lectures were not interesting, but the assignments were very clear, and the class wasn't much work.  I felt that she graded fairly, and I found her very willing to help with these assignments and answer any questions I had.  It definitely wasn't necessary to do the readings (or to pay attention to the lectures), so I found this class to be low-stress and requiring little effort.  I thought Ms. Allen did as good a job with this class as anyone could, and any failings in this course were with the material itself, and not the instructor.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-04-22T02:48:20.132672Z"}, {"professor": "Stephanie Allen", "course": "ENGL101", "review": "Boring class, but there isn\u2019t much Ms. Allen can do about that.

It's a lot of writing(duhh its english) so if ur not good at it... praying for you<3\r\n\r\nthe fact I'm even complaining abt an ENGLISH class as a STEM major goes to show how much i highly do NOT recommend you take it with this professor. Some of her grading is fair but she takes off points for NO reason. if you have no other choice but to take her, my tip for success for any assignment, especially major ones:\r\nFOLLOW THE RUBRIC DOWN TO THE LETTER!! You have to go to class for discussions and draft workshops cause those will kill ur grade if u miss them and u can't be late either cause they literally start as soon as class is scheduled to start\r\nYou can ask for an extension and she will give you one(if it's within valid reason obvi (literally 1/5th of the class had a CS project due the day one of the major assignments was due)), but she still took off points for turning it in after the original due date\r\nHer lecturers are so boring and it's sad when no one participates without her calling their name specifically...but then I remember how she will literally interrupt you if she thinks you aren't answering her question so karma ig?\r\nIdk anyway, choose peace, choose LITERALLY anyone but her\r\n\r\n(oh and the \"assigned readings\" have no relation to the class other than her referencing them in her lectures so if u read them or worse, buy the book, it is lowkey a waste of time cause u will not need any of the information from it unless she posts it on canvas)\r\n\r\nGodspeed to whoever is reading this <3", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "B+", "created": "2023-12-06T06:40:53.877609Z"}, {"professor": "Stephanie Allen", "course": "ENGL101", "review": "She is VERY boring in class and shows literally no emotion during her lectures.
