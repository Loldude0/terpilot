It is definitely not an easy class, but if you put in the work, then you will do well. If you need extra help, go to office hours, she is super happy to help, and it always makes the information easier to understand after. The final was worth about too much at about 30 percent, but other than that, the class is structured greatly. She gives out clicker points for coming to class, and it doesn't matter if you get them right, so just show up to class. Also, she records all of her lectures so you can go back and watch them before the tests. She doesn't curve the individual tests, but after every exam, she adjusts the letter grade cut-offs.

HOWEVER, this has /nothing/ to do Dr. Griffith, it's just how the class is set up, and she can't change it. This lab really teaches you how to collect data, put together a lab report, and analyze data. Your grades will go up and down throughout the semester, and the reports do take a decent amount of time but I still enjoyed this class. It also depends on the TA who ends up grading your report. You can and should always go to her office hours for more information. You can also submit regrade requests if you feel like something was unfairly graded and you deserved more points. She usually gives some back. There are also more free points than you realize, so don't worry. Complete your lit assignments, trust me, especially with the bonus points.\r\nALSO, three important things: go to class for participation points, turn in assignments on time or 10% deduction, and try to avoid Monday lab. The lecture is Friday, where you'll learn all the important information for your report. So you have the weekend to fix it, but this semester anyway, she didn't have OH on Monday so we couldn't get more info. So yeah, avoid Monday lab.\r\nAnd no need for a fancy lab notebook, just get one from Amazon. \r\nFinally, she curves (not by that much by still a good amount), so again, don't stress over your overall grade. \r\nDr. Griffith is probably my favorite chemistry professor I've ever had. She loves teaching this class, she's such a kind person, and I enjoyed being in her class despite the workload. Don't listen to the bad reviews. She's incredible. \r\nAnd BTW if you're a Biochem or Chem major, don't take CHEM132 because it will complicate things when completing your major. Take 177 because it is the requirement. Otherwise, you're giving your future self a big headache. Technically 177 gives credit for 132, but 132 does not for 177. So you HAVE to take it.

For 2 credits, you are expected to do a pre-lab assignment, prepare your notebook for class, go to lab, complete a LOONG lab workup, and a literature assignment every week. The amount of time I spent weekly on CHEM177 surpassed the time I spent on any of my 3 or 4 credit courses without fail every week. This is a weed-out class for biochemistry and chemistry majors, but once you make it past this you'll be alright. Grading is picky and harsh; don't wait until the last minute and turn in a clearly bad quality assignment (you probably won't get away with it like you did in high school). There is little consideration for external circumstances and turning things in late (even on accident) is not tolerated. There are very severe consequences for late work, so check to make sure you turned in reports on time multiple times.
