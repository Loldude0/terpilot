I was told the class is an easy A and yes it is, most of the grades are based on completion and the course load is really small there are only a few larger assignments where you have to interview a writer for an individual project and group project and you have to write papers about it but it is pretty easy. The professor is just trying to get people to work well in groups as if they were in the workplace. The professor overall is very unorganized and confusing at some points, assignment due dates usually get pushed because she didn't do something she was supposed to do. Attendance is not mandatory but some days there will be in-class graded assignments and if you aren't there it is sometimes difficult to make it up without an excused absence. The class is pointless but I took it as a gen-ed and didn't really have to worry about this course and my grade in it.", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-05-08T17:14:10.650788Z"}, {"professor": "Elizabeth Marshall", "course": "ENGL297", "review": "I really enjoyed the class because the class focused on working in team, finding professional writer for interview. There are very few assignments outside of the class. The course follow labor based grading, so turning assignment will ensure the points.

I'd give her 5 stars but her class was just annoyingly boring and slow at times. The workload for this class was very easily manageable, but just make sure you pay attention to deadlines as you have to plan ahead for some things. The actual assignments are relatively open-ended, and Liz is really good at working with you if you need direction or help. A lot of this class in class is discussion-based, so be prepared to talk and speak up. That being said, my experience was it doesn't really matter what you say as long as you say something so don't stress it's not that deep. The only other thing was that attendance is important. I missed a few classes which set me back on deadlines and most notably participation assignments in class. Legit just show up, engage a bit here and there, do your work on time, and you're golden. The course had one big group assignment, one big independent assignment, a few in-class participation assignments, like a minor essay or two, and just a few discussions. Also, the textbook is useless I didn't buy it and never needed it.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "B+", "created": "2024-01-25T18:45:30.223166Z"}], "name": "Elizabeth Marshall", "slug": "marshall_elizabeth"}
