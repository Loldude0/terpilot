Her midterms are not hard at all if you do her practice exams, I mean literally we had 2 graph problems that we need to do ourselves then the next 30 or so questions are just multiple choices, and I appreciate she often do not test us on those controversial and theoretical questions. She is very reachable after class and have confidence in yourself, I'm writing this as I'm holding a 1.7 cumulative GPA, this class is not hard compare to other science courses I had at UMD, there is no nasty number and confusing formulas that you need to memorize, a good understanding of the demand and supply curve is sufficient enough.
