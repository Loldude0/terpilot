I really enjoyed his breakdown of the class. Homeworks (which include both theory/proofs and coding and application) were tough but fair. His office hours were helpful whenever I had questions. His exams were more intuition/big-picture concept questions and were a lot easier than the homeworks. The final project is a final report integrating the various machine learning approaches we have learned in class. I like how he designs the report to be possibly used as a mini-portfolio/reference for the future. While Dr. Ray is a new professor at UMD, I would say that he is already one of my favorite teachers. He sometimes goes a little quickly through the slides but all his lecture slides are posted on ELMS. I would highly recommend this class and Dr. Ray if you are interested in learning more about machine learning approaches!", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-12-11T01:33:23.726768Z"}], "name": "Deep Ray", "slug": "ray_deep"}
