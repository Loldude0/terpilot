This is only a small summary of the issues in this class. Projects are way too hard in comparison for how casually he teaches and test questions seem to be first drafts without any revision.

But it is not this semester. Morawski is a cool, fun guy. Maybe caring according to my friends, but he is far away from good professor this semester. \r\nHe has a few little lecture slides at the beginning of the semester, but no more after he decided to remake the class. We get speaker notes sometimes, but it is only converging the topics he went over. Furthermore, the lectures he gave doesn't teach us how to do our projects and exams well. We basically need to learn how to do the project on our own - it is much workload that I was expecting for CMSC320. It is probably the workload similar to CMSC216. BTW I start projects early so I can ask TA for help, but they are still time consuming and suffering because you have to find out what are expecting (the project description doesn't always tell you where you graded on) and teach yourselves (since you didn't really learn how to do the project yourself)\r\nAlso, I do agree that he is trying to make \"us to think data-wise and not just be code monkeys\".

I personally really enjoy his class and he makes lectures fun. \r\n\r\nThe way he is teaching CMSC320 is unusual but it comes from a person who has worked in the field, which holds a lot of value in my eyes. \r\n\r\nProjects: not easy but he is reusing projects from other semesters so I don\u2019t understand why people are complaining. A lot of project work is fully self taught, which isn\u2019t unusual for CS courses. The project grading is lenient and Max is super easy to talk to if you have any issues. If you don\u2019t want to self learn then you are going to have a lot of trouble in various CS courses, it\u2019s just how it is unfortunately \r\n\r\nExam 1: This exam was online so we had access to Google and any notes we had taken. The average was around 65% but Max is giving us a generous curve and again, none of this is unusual for a CMSC course, it\u2019s only really bad if the professor isn\u2019t fair with curving based on the averages, which is not the case here. There were technical difficulties but Max accommodated for that and helped anyone that had issues. Also, the vast majority of the grade comes from projects so this isn\u2019t even a big deal\r\n\r\nLectures: Max talks about the fundamental topics briefly and doesn\u2019t go into too much detail. Again, most of the code you will learn is self taught and contained in the projects, lecture is for high level explanations of the different topics of the course. Max also shares stories about projects he had to do in industry and problem solving techniques he used to get his solutions. All very practical and useful information. if you\u2019re a geek that doesn\u2019t care about real life and want to stuff your face in a text book and fully learn everything in depth, this gem of a lecturer isn\u2019t for you. \r\n\r\nOverall thoughts: I personally think this class is a breath of fresh air amongst the sea of boring and difficult computer science courses. Max actually makes me want to come to lecture as opposed to feeling like I have to. I love having professors that are easy to talk to and feel more down to earth. This is definitely one of the rare instances of a professor that understands that students have a life outside of their course and is willing to accommodate for real excuses. \r\n\r\nOther ratings: I honestly feel like Max is getting a lot of unfair reviews. This is his first semester teaching the course and he is demonstrating a clear willingness to learn and improve as a professor. There are lots of complaints about the unorganized lecture styles, which is a fair criticism that I\u2019m sure he will address in the future, but also bs criticism about an exam that isn\u2019t worth very much of our grade and projects that he didn\u2019t even write? These are literally reused projects from other semesters so if that\u2019s the complaint then you have a problem with the class, not Max. There seems to be two sides to this. If you want to hear real life experiences and get advice about how to make it in the industry, then you\u2019ll like Max. If you\u2019re looking for a professor that solely focuses on teaching the class material, then Max is not for you.\r\n\r\nConclusion: He a little confused but he got the spirit", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "B", "created": "2022-11-12T11:32:52.662848Z"}, {"professor": "Maksym Morawski", "course": "CMSC320", "review": "Great professor that is a little unorganized but makes up for it with real life industry work experience.

Most of the contents I learned from this class were from Kruskal's videos and online resources. I hope Max could become more familiar with the topics over the summer and incorporate a structured approach to teaching in the future. For example, Max, if you're reading this, it would be helpful to have slides containing important notes for the class. While it's great to work through examples during the lecture, including them in the slides would save time (color-coded and animated). It would be ideal if the slides could be shared before or after the lecture.\r\n- Exams. Just terrifying. Well, it's not Max's fault because Kruskal wrote them, but my midterms haunted me. \r\n- Grading. It was really slow this semester due to the complications with the TAs; but it will improve, hopefully.\r\nAdvices:\r\n- If Kruskal is going to write the exams for Max's classes, then study the homework religiously. There were practice exams, but not really helpful. You should still do it for extra practices, but mostly focus on the homework of all the topics that would appear on the exam. \r\n- Go to office hours.

As a result, we got all of Kruskal\u2019s exams and homework assignments which are notoriously difficult. Max did not have control over what was being taught and the difficulty of assessments since Kruskal was in charge, and as a result, he sometimes stumbled over content (it\u2019s hard to keep up with a mad scientist). It honestly seems like Kruskal and Max hate each other (understandably so) since there was a lot of miscommunication throughout the semester. To pass this class, this is what I did: I showed up to Max\u2019s lecture with the expectation of getting a simplified overview. I did have to supplement the content to keep up: Kruskal has pre-recorded videos that go into the content in depth, and I binge watched those videos and reviewed the homework\u2019s a few days before the exams. The exams feel similar to the homework assignments, but at the same time they are different, so it felt like a big wildcard, and I found it better to just YOLO the exams than to stress about them. My mantra: take inspiration from the homework assignments and express your creativity on the exams. I had no idea what I was doing on any of the exams, but try to grab the \u201ceasy\u201d points and think on your feet. \r\n\r\nMax as a lecturer: he\u2019s naturally charismatic and has a geeky sense of humor. I feel like he genuinely wants the class to pass. Even though at times Max was confused, at least he was enthusiastic while being confused? He would drop hints about the exam topics during the review which was helpful to dial in on, and his encouragement to keep us going while we were all flopping was helpful. At the end of the semester, his cutoffs were a lot more generous than Kruskal\u2019s. For example, Kruskal\u2019s version of an A- was an 80.5% while Max\u2019s version of an A- was 69%. \r\n\r\nTLDR: if Max ever teaches 351 with Kruskal again, take it with Max and hang on for dear life.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A-", "created": "2023-05-28T18:30:51.198350Z"}, {"professor": "Maksym Morawski", "course": "CMSC351", "review": "Max is a great person, but maybe not the best professor when it comes to co-teaching with Kruskal.

Max was forced to co-teach with Kruskal, in which Max was not very happy with as far as I know, because Max had little to no control over the material. Kruskal and Max were both discontent at each other, because Max didn't want to follow what Kruskal does.\r\n\r\nI think Kruskal's material is fine. His homeworks are definitely hard, but if you go to the TA's or especially Kruskal's office hours, they will explain what the problems mean. And that's really it, Kruskal's problems are all about understanding of the material. What this problem wants us to do, what this algorithm does, why this algorithm behaves such a way, what this problem accomplishes, and why this problem is relevant, etc. If you really understand that, then Kruskal's 351 homeworks and exams will come off pretty easy. As for the notorious last \"coding interview\" problem on the exams, if you can do Leetcode medium without difficulty, you will do well :). But jokes aside, these \"interview\" questions get a lot of hate because there's really no way to prepare or study for these questions, but like I said, if you understand what this problem is trying to accomplish, then they should come off pretty easy. It's all about critical thinking, testing you whether you can come up with an efficient solution, and you will get partial credit even when you write a brute force solution. Kruskal doesn't want you to write 50-100 line of code that does complex stuff, the solutions to his coding problems are always simple pseudocode. Kruskal may be very disorganized and just not good at administering class, but he is seriously one of the most knowledgeable people in the faculty, and you will learn a lot when you go to Kruskal's office hours. He's been teaching and researching algorithm and theory for decades, and it shows.\r\n\r\nNow, onto Max. Like I said, Max wanted to go with Justin's material to teach his class, so him being forced to follow Kruskal's material was probably stressful for him. I'll give him credit for trying his best. He's definitely someone who wants his students to pass the class, although that is not evident in his teaching, but in the curve. He gave a lot more substantial curve than Kruskal's even when Kruskal's curve was pretty large, which was about one letter grade difference, although the pass/fail cutoff was comparable for both of them. Does Max teach well? Well, that's another matter.\r\n\r\nI think the problem with Max is that he severely lacks knowledge on the material. It's not that Kruskal's material is different from Justin's or whatever, he just doesn't know the subject well enough to lecture it. I'm sure Max is very competent when it comes to an actual practice as an engineer given his career, but I think his teaching is very shallow, although he has potential to improve. I definitely think Max wants to become the next Justin, someone who is approachable to his students, explains the concepts well, and have the majority of his students get an A. The thing is, I barely learned anything from Max's lectures. Pretty much the entire knowledge I learned came from Kruskal's recorded lectures and his office hours. The difference in the level of quality in answers you get from Kruskal's office hours and Max's office hours is pretty significant. I definitely think that Max will improve a lot, but I can't say that I learned a lot from him.\r\n\r\nDespite the co-teaching, there is a pretty huge difference in the philosophy of teaching 351 between Kruskal and Max. Kruskal emphasizes in thinking about the problems and how to solve them creatively. The problems may be challenging, but you gain so much once you solve them. The way Max seemingly wanted to run this class is like a standard class, where you just take notes and you can do well on the exam just from the rote memorization. The difference in the philosophy of the subject is probably why Max and Kruskal were so unhappy with each other. I personally think that critical thinking and understanding is much more crucial rather than simple regurgitation when it comes to algorithm and theory. This is probably why I learned a lot more from Kruskal and give him more credit than Max. But I think Max has a lot of potential and I definitely do see Max as a good lecturer in a few years.\r\n\r\nOne thing I will note about 351 is that it is very poorly structured and Max did his best for his first semester teaching it. It's not about exams taking 80%+ of the course but really more about the content of 351. 351 is too much math and analysis heavy, and I do wish the class teach more interesting stuff like dynamic programming instead of spending too much time on sorting algorithms, constructive induction, and NP etc. The way Kruskal structured 351 is pretty unique and arguably odd compared to algorithm classes at other CS schools, so I can definitely feel Max's frustration in having to be forced to teach that way only.

This semester, the class weights were 40% homework, 10% lab worksheets, 30% midterms (2 midterms), and 20% final. The homework problems were difficult, but you were able to get most done on your own (you have at least a week to do each of them) and if you had any questions about any of the problems you could go to office hours and the TAs would help you understand them better. The worksheets were every Wednesday and they were done in discussion (some TAs would go over how to do the problems, but mine didn't) and they were graded on completion. The midterms were fine for the most part, but on both midterms, there was a problem where very few people got them completely right (e.g only 5-10% of people got full credit for them) so your exam grade basically dropped a letter grade just from that one problem (on the first midterm that problem ended up getting dropped, but it was a special circumstance).

The last homework was released so late that we were basically expected to work on it over Thanksgiving break, when it was originally supposed to be due 2 weeks before break.

Lectures seemed more like a stand up routine to him. As other reviewers said, the slides have minimal info, and equations are often wrong. There's no clear definitions for anything, you'll have to look elsewhere. Everything is taught in an example/high level way but you are expected to understand and replicate at a low detailed level. For example, with hypothesis tests, you will not find detailed definitions in the slides that include everything he wants you to know. You have to google these things or use the other prof's slides.

There are still truths to some complaints here, but the positives are still far greater than the negatives and the way it's taught is so unique so I think people should still take this class with Max (or at least go to his 320 lectures when they happen, since they're quite interesting, humorous, and thought provoking).\r\nFirst, the cons: Yes, the class was quite disorganized, we had an assignment due in October that wasn't graded until the last day of finals. Some problems were unclear or needed us to search up information on our own (but this research was very simple and not really an issue). He is unprepared sometimes; he mentioned some lectures went way faster than expected, or will forget to put something very important on slides, and also stopped posting recordings for lectures which made it a bit hard to study for exams. Additionally, he isn't the best at math, so he'll sometimes make mistakes on some slides or formulas, but in practice we hardly used formulas so this hardly disrupted the flow of the class. In terms of grades, the other section for Fall 2023 (with Fardina) was basically a guaranteed A (the average on Max's exams was about 77%, Fardina's average on exams was about 92%) so honestly, if grade is the [only] thing you care about, maybe you should take it with Fardina based on the stats.\r\nBut Max's section and thoughts have many positives: The overall grade for the regular assignments and final project (which were worth 55% of the class) was at 95% so no one really risked failing the class, and most of these took just around 2-4 hours to complete since there are lots of guides to do what was asked. Where Max really shines is in his lectures: they were the most consistently engaging ones that I've been through at the university, always getting people to ask questions, cracking jokes and being relatable on what being in CS is like. The way he teaches the course isn't just learning data science in how to design & execute an experiment, because he also notes where it's relevant and useful (he mentions how Goodhart's law is seen in practice through grade inflation, I wonder where this could be present...), what the industry currently uses in practice (how does Netflix or Amazon actually recommend things), and bringing his own industry experience to elaborate on what we would do working in data science. Additionally, he also goes on some important side tangents about other important topics, like critically thinking about what grades are, career advice and thinking about interviews, how to ingest ethics in practice, and other considerations in life that many other professors don't touch (he informally holds a group of people that learn more on these general life skills).
