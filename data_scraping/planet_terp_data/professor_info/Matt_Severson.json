The professor would always push back exams and assignments at the last minute because he was behind in lectures. His lecture slides are outdated (from the Fall of 2021) and he rambles on about irrelevant information that had no relevance to the exams. He was also very unapproachable from my experience, from office hours when his door is almost shut with the lights off to emails that are not professional and are very little help. He also did not follow the rule of grading final exams within 48 hours and that was probably because we still had 2 homework assignments ungraded. Overall, the workload was not much. You had unlimited homework attempts, 3 exams, a project, and attendance questions. But the class is boring and the professor is not the greatest.", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-12-27T19:36:55.513843Z"}, {"professor": "Matt Severson", "course": "PHYS261", "review": "Hated this useless class but easy A.
