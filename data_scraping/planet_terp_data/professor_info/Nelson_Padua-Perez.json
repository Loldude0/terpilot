His personality is so nice and he's HILARIOUS in class. He makes it fun to learn and a lot easier to pay attention in class. I am a newbie to computer science so the class itself was a little difficult. Nelson is a good guy for people new to computer science because he will make your introduction to compsci very fun. \r\nThe first midterm for us was really easy and was just like the practice study guide they gave us. The second midterm was ridiculously difficult. It was impossible for anyone with no experience prior to have done well on that exam. Even people that were experienced were depressed after the exam. As for the final, it was a lot better. It wasn't too difficult like the first one but it was still challenging. Make sure to study a lot and go to all the discussions and lectures and to try to learn on your own time because class time is not enough. This class is tailored more for the experienced kids so being a newbie is quite the disadvantage. The whole \"you don't need any experience prior\" was one of the biggest lies I was told. Also be aware of cheating and copying other people's projects or even collaborating. There was a whole thing this year where the professors are going to prosecute those who cheated on projects which will result in an XF (failure and cheating mark) that will stay with you forever even if you retake the class. It's also better to do it on your own because you learn a lot more that way. \r\nBTW: TA hours are a HUGE mess. It's always packed in the TA office and you have to wait a long time for the TA to even come to you to help you. Kinda why I don't understand why the rules for even talking about the projects together are so strict, but can't really do anything about it. Don't show anyone your code and don't ask anyone for theirs. It's a serious issue.\r\nTIP: Do really well on the projects because those were the only things holding my grade up (as well as the quizzes). You can bomb the exams and still get a decent grade if you do extremely well on quizzes and projects.

He is decent at lecturing most of the time, but that is not too much of a merit, since he just reads off slides. I have asked questions both in class, and in office hours, and I have never received a satisfactory answer. For example, one time in class, he offered an opportunity for us to ask questions about the current project we were working on. When I asked a question, he told me my question was too complicated to understand, and instead of letting me clarify, he instead told me that he wouldn't answer my question, and would be moving on to the next topic. I decided to go to his office hours to try and clarify my question. However, he would not even let me finish my question before interrupting, and repeatedly telling me my confusion regarding the project was because I had not read the public tests (which is a solution not remotely related to my original question). He was very rude and discourteous the entire time I was in his office.\n\r\nHe uses Piazza (sort of like a forum), under the pretense of having TAs or fellow students being able to help answer questions regarding the class. However, he only uses Piazza as a way to avoid answering nuanced questions himself. This was quite obvious the other times I had attended his office hours, when he would simply tell me to ask my question to the TAs instead.\n\r\nAs noted in other reviews, he stops lecture to call out students unnecessarily for the most ridiculous things. Aside from it not being funny, it is quite embarrassing to be put on the spot like that.\n\r\nHe is able to still be popular among students because he makes frequent jokes all throughout class. While some of them can be funny, a lot of the jokes I find to be annoying. He jokes about marijuana, cocaine, drinking, etc., in order to project a \"chill\" image which the typical college student will find hysterical.\n\r\nTo summarize this review, Nelson has repeatedly proven he is rude, unable to answer questions that are nuanced, and desperate to be liked. Those genuinely are the three most dangerous traits an instructor can have, as he will find opportunities to belittle you throughout the semester if he knows you don't like him.

He gives you previous exams to practice but the questions he asks on the exam are totally different. I am talking about studying for 4 days straight and still failing kinda hard. On one exam everyone did bad on and he still didn't curve it or find a way to help us out because of how badly it affected our grades. The projects aren't totally awful until you get near the end of the semester, I would say you are working on a project every day of the week through the semester. But most people do better on the projects than on the exams and that's what helps your grade. There are certain TA's that aren't really much help and it's so difficult to make a meeting with a TA for no reason. I have never seen so many people struggle with one class until I took CMSC131. I really don't recommend this class to anyone and if I could go back in time and not take this class I would. This class ruined my first semester of freshman year.

Nelson is a decent teacher, but be prepared that he moves really fast. \r\nYour first 2-3 weeks of semester should just be spent constantly coding small tasks to get familiar with java and eclipse. It will help so much. Also watch YouTube vids to try to get ahead.   The tests are hard as well so prepare early to write your code instead of type. The previous tests he gives as examples are ALWAYS much easier then actual test, so know / understand them like the back of your hand. The projects help you learn the most because they take HOURS. I would have the expectation that each one will take at least 8 hours. start them as soon as they are released and bounce ideas of friends as much as you can. DO NOT CHEAT OR SHOW CODE to others.  the TAs will notice if you copy. Just explain what you did and how in words and you should be okay. Use your peers as support in this class because it is easy to get stuck. \r\n\r\nNelson review:\r\nHe is good teacher will slight accent and decent humor. overall is nice and down to earth(insists you call him nelson). His lectures are not the most organized and he tends to bounce around which can be confusing. Luckily you can watch them back and try to understand.  He is relatively accessible in office hours, but tends to come off as an overpowering personality in person. I suspect this is because he lectures groups more then teaches individuals. I also think he knows this and try's to improve(only somewhat successful).  I am trying to take him next semester for 132. He is defiantly not perfect, but he is far better then some other shit teachers at UMD. \r\n\r\nPs.

If you're the type of person to get kind of bored during boring old slide lectures then he's good for you! He relies on examples in the lecture and a few small concepts from the slides. He gives us one-minute breaks in between heavy topics/examples so that we can discuss it with our neighbors, which I find really helpful in keeping everyone interactive and actually paying attention esp in a morning class. His exams are doable as long as you do the past exams/practice he gives which is really helpful. His third exam; however, was overly long and challenging compared to his others so it tanked a lot of people's grades, but he just released grades and seemed to have provided a better cutoff to benefit (f.e. some A grades were considered A+ and so on), so as long as you put the work in you should be golden in terms of your grade (it's not meant to be challenging to get an A or B). Also, his projects are definitely on the challenging side sometimes especially later in the year with Recursion and the class implementations, but if you study his class lecture code and ask for help during office hours (always go early otherwise you probably won't get a chance if it's close to the project deadline). Overall, he explains things effectively for the most part and I'd recommend reading some notes on the topics before coming into class on the first day just so you have a good idea of what coding in Java is about and you aren't bombarded too fast!

He is really laid back, chill, and constantly makes jokes and finds interesting ways to keep students engaged. This was my first time coding in Java and Nelson made it very straight forward and doable.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- Nelson is a very funny and likable guy. On the first day of classes he will tell you that he always wants you to call him by his first name which I found interesting.\r\n- He is very good at making analogies between programming and more understandable topics. For example, he would make an analogy between a bakery and objects in java. This makes it really easy to understand his teaching, even for first time programmers like me.\r\n- His lecture slides are much more detailed than Fawsi's (from what I have heard)\r\n- His exams are very much like the previous exams. As long as you study those, and the additional resources that Nelson provides, you will be more than fine on the exams.\r\n- Occasionally during every lecture, Nelson likes to say \"1 minute\" which indicates that we can talk to our neighbor for a minute and digest the information that he just lectured about. I found this useful and made the class less fast paced\u2014 gave me time to breathe while learning new information. After this minute break, he opens the floor for a few questions before returning to his lecture.\r\n- Nelson uploads the code for every class example and provides many many resources to ensure you do well on the projects and exams.\r\n- Grading for exams is honestly pretty lenient. Because all the midterms include hand-written coding, it is easy to miss the small nuances that come with programming but the TAs that grade your tests know this. Often times when you look at the grading break down, you are given points on a segment of code just for \"ATTEMPTING to _______\"\r\n- Very accommodating in regards to extending deadlines for things. He even encourages that the class speaks up if we need an extension.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- His funny personality sometimes gets in the way of the actual teaching. Yes it does lighten up the mood but often he will stop mid sentence just to pop in a joke. Additionally, some of his comedy is offensive or will get stale. For example, he once made a statement to the guys in the class about how they should not feel bad if a girl rejects them. He then goes on with his joke and says that girls are like \"instance variables\" and how the guys should just \"pick another one\" if one doesn't work. If you know anything about Java, you will know that he basically just called women \"objects\". I didn't think too much about this but I can see why some people would find his humor offensive. He also always makes the joke \"turn to your neighbor and tell them they are a (insert random java terminology)\" which literally makes no sense and gets old after the first couple times.\r\n- The third midterm was a nightmare. In the past, there have only been two midterms and the third was only added a couple years ago. This means that there is little study material and the worst part is that the second and third midterm are only 2 weeks apart since they kind of just shoved it into the curriculum. The class average for midterms is usually pretty high but dropped to a D average for this midterm. Nelson did adjust the letter grade cut offs for final grades because of this though.\r\n- Projects become very challenging towards the end of the semester. This is obviously necessary to challenge students but sometimes they are impossible to figure out without a TA.\r\n- Frankly, sometimes it is difficult to understand his accent and it leaves you to think more about what words he is saying in the first place rather than the actual content within his sentences.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think Nelson is the better option for CMSC131. He is very knowledgable and it is clear that he comes prepared for class with examples to explain complex ideas to new programmers. Just beware of his random remarks. It is clear that he is looking for validation and wants to be liked by his students so he makes jokes on topics that students our age would find \"funny\".

If anything, the TAs are more helpful than Nelson himself.\r\n- As anecdotal evidence, he created a 3rd exam (in the past there were only 2) which covered a bunch of topics. I went to the exam review and the TA told us not to review this one topic. Next thing you know that topic is on the exam!!! I heard that half of the class did POORLY on that exam (including me).

Also, he reused a lot of multiple choice questions from his past midterms. I suspect the final exam was also written by him, because the multiple choice questions were very similar if not the same as some of the questions on past midterms. I finished the final exam with about 45 minutes left, so it was extremely doable.

There's a website called Piazza where students can ask and answer questions, and TAs and Nelson himself are active on there too, posting announcements and answering questions. This is definitely helpful when you're working on a project and confused on wording, for instance. All lectures and discussions are recorded and available on Canvas, so if you ever miss a day or want to go back on a concept discussed in a lecture or discussion, you can always do so. The projects really weren't hard, but that might not be true for others because I have previous programming experience and many others in the class do not. Just make sure to start them early and get them done with; I usually finished projects a day or two after they were released so I could focus on other classes. That being said, I do feel like his exams were frustrating. If you misinterpret what a question is asking (you can't ask a TA or Nelson on wording either; they won't and can't really help you on that without giving you hints on it) you will lose points, even if you knew the answer to another interpretation of a question. However, I do feel like the content itself on the exams were very fair, and he did give information on possible content the exams would have. His final is pretty easy as long as you go over previous midterms and finals. The thing that annoyed me the most were lectures, because while Nelson joked around and gave us time to talk to our classmates, he spent a lot of time off-track and I felt like this could have been better used to teach us concepts from 132 and above. He does give you knowledge that you will see or need to understand later (such as memory maps, and you will need to understand how memory in a program works in 216), but I feel like he could have done more in this regard.

Most of the weight are in the coding questions, and they are pretty easy.  If that's not enough, Nelson gives us so much review material.  For exams 1 and 2, he gave us material dating back to 2014.  For exam 3, he gave us a ton of process worksheets and quizzes.  The final review material was a bit lacking, as nothing really covered threads all that well, but that's minor if you could understand exercise 6 and actually watched the lecture videos at the end.  Even then, the final was only worth 10% of the grade, so if you did well on everything else it's nothing to worry about.\r\n\r\nThe exercises and projects were kinda neat, but it was kinda back to back to back on that front.  Just, please work on them early.  If you get stuck, especially if you can't go to in-person office hours, virtual office hours were pretty crowded this summer by the project due dates, so go early.  You may lose some secret test points here and there as I did, but if your implementation is mostly correct, it shouldn't be a big issue regarding your overall course grade, granted you do well on the exams.\r\n\r\nIf you do take this course over the summer and want to do it mostly asynchronously, as Nelson set up another section just for this, just please don't try and take advantage of Nelson.  It will not work.  Piazza was kind of a nightmare this summer, and part of that was due to requests like \"can the lowest project be dropped,\" despite the grading scheme being clearly laid out in the syllabus at the start of the semester.  Nelson laid out from the beginning of the semester that this is a very demanding course, and he cannot grant extensions for arbitrary reasons (he is very lenient about extensions and whatnot when it comes to genuine issues unrelated to workload).  Unless you have plenty of experience in C and assembly, you will likely struggle at some point in the course, so start things early.  Even worse, do not attempt to cross Nelson by cheating.  He is not lenient at all about academic dishonesty, and he will request an XF if he has any proof of someone cheating.  He has the terms laid out in the syllabus like just about every CS professor.\r\n\r\nIf you can pick things up semi-quickly, and you don't flood yourself with other responsibilities, you will have a good time in this course.  Nelson said at the beginning that if you do your part, there's a good chance you'll get an A in his class.  It's certainly doable to take this alongside either another class or a job/internship, but just know that the class doesn't slow down because you're doing that.\r\n\r\nOverall, with some of the horror stories I've heard about 216 (particularly with Yoon), this class was nothing like that.

I have realized I made a big mistake of taking him when I realized how his class is all over the place and gets way overly distracted. I appreciate the jokes, but it gets to be too much when I am just trying to learn the content. Like I genuinely haven't ever learned anything from his lectures whenever I go to them. I only learn from watching his summer lectures, in which he explains things better and more seriously. He expects us to watch videos from his lectures back in the summer, and then expects us to come into class somewhat knowing the material and lectures are more like a review session, which I really don't like, because I will sit in lecture for 75 minutes unable to concentrate because he will either talk about something I have no idea about, or go on a tangent about love lives idk. Like personally I do not have the time to watch entire lectures from previous semesters on top of lectures we have in person with all my other classes. Now let me get into the real reason why he's only getting 2 stars....HIS PROJECTS. Oh...my...god, the descriptions are so bad and confusing, and his third project genuinely made me want to cry. Not only does he assign projects, he also assigns exercises, which are like mini projects every week. So we generally have an exercise and a whole project in the same week.
