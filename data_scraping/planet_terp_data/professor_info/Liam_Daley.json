His classes were asynchronous but he was very appreciative towards anyone who showed up. He provides lots of chances for extra credit and doesn\u2019t give a lot of low grades unless you don\u2019t do the assignment, although he doesn\u2019t seem to give 100s on any major papers judging from the grade distributions. His lectures were kind of rambley but that\u2019s most likely because it\u2019s hard to teach to a computer. He did say that the textbook is required, although all textbook readings were optional so it\u2019s not exactly a necessity.

He makes an effort to connect with his students in class, he is extremely funny, and although he tends to go off on tangents, all of his class discussions are thoroughly meaningful and relevant to the topics in class. The quizzes are easy if you have done the assigned readings before class and there are lots of opportunities on them for extra credits. \r\nThe major assignments in this class include two papers and one presentation, both of which he gave us extreme flexibility with on content and still managed to be relevant and thought-provoking. \r\nOverall, the class is extremely fun and everyone in it seems to enjoy it greatly as class participation is very high and enthusiastic.

He seemed to disapprove of the generic, repetitive academic writing style. This is clearly shown in his grading, which is fine but I wish he could have expressed that. Many professors often approve of this style but he is set in his ways.
