She's really great at teaching the material and the in-class discussion was really interesting and engaging. For WGSS290, all three exams were online and had no time limit. The rest of the grades for the class were essays, the group project, debate, and class participation. There were daily readings which were pretty hefty (like 15-30 pages), and the assignments definitely required effort. \r\n\r\nIf you find the class description interesting, take the class, you will not regret it. If not, imo it's a lot more work for just 3 credits and the gened.

Very passionate about the material so you can offend her/class easily. It can be a lot of work because you find the topic to do the projects on. The readings are long and difficult to understand but not necessary to participate in the discussion. The class participation can be a little unfair so don't skip the class.

This course is discussion-based, and includes a lot of interesting material that can help you to challenge your perceptions of the world. The work is easy if you pay attention, though. One thing to keep in mind is that the reading can be a little difficult and verbose if you're not used to certain topics in philosophy, as much of the assignments rely on applying Foucault in some way.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2022-06-14T20:06:58Z"}, {"professor": "Jessica Mathiason", "course": "WGSS319D", "review": "Dr. Mathiason\u2019s class was easily my favorite this semester.

The content was really interesting and I learned a lot. This class is very liberal. Make sure to skim over the readings before class so you have something to talk about when you participate. Aim to participate at least once every class. START ON THE GROUP PROJECTS EARLY. She gives you only like two weeks to finish em so just get it out of the way. Follow the directions on the quiz. Use a google doc to take notes so you can easily ctrl-f during a quiz. The work load is pretty low. She gives lots of feedback on your work. She's a nice person and easy to talk to.

Readings are dense but you should read them because she asks questions about them during class. Projects are fairly straightforward and flexible, should be easy to get a good grade if you write well. Honestly the defining course of the health, humanities, and medicine minor, highly recommend Prof Mathiason for this!", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "", "created": "2023-06-14T00:53:11.490072Z"}, {"professor": "Jessica Mathiason", "course": "LGBT200", "review": "Great course and love Dr. Mathiason!

I had no idea what this class was about and signed up for it last minute because it had many geneds. It was super eye opening and everyone in my class was so passionate about the topic which really kept me interested. Highly highly recommend. Lots of great discussions and important topics. Dr. Mathiason is a great professor with a lot of knowledge and opinions on the topic.\r\n\r\nPros: 3 Open note, untimed quizzes (a few short answer and a short essay), posted slides (no need to take notes), attendance isn't mandatory, small class so discussion based, Dr. Mathiason is very approachable and passionate(she learned everyone's names which was really sweet), there are some extra credit opportunities, most people in my class got A's or B's i believe\r\n\r\nCons: Very long readings (I'm talking 30 pages per class :/) the readings aren't super necessary, but they help you participate and are pretty interesting usually, the projects/paper give you a lot of freedom which can be good or bad, grading on the paper was a little tough, group project and debate were pretty difficult for me, some topics may be triggering for some people??\r\n\r\nAdvice: Listen and participate when you can! Start thinking of ideas for the group project early. This is definitely not an easy class even though there are not many assignments. You can ask for an extension also.
