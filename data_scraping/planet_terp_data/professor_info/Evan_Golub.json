As you embark on your journey through the mystifying complex universe of computer science, you have no idea what to expect. You could be dealing with the unforeseen; singularities caused by Eclipse phenomenons, encounters with fierce, atrocious bugs on the submit server, or even bang you head on your very own $800 laptop as you scream at the ambiguous results of the release tests! A toilet bowl of intellectual thoughts flurries around your noggin; there could be computers, video games, cameras, programming, computers, flying cellphones, virtual pinball and more!\r\nThen all of a sudden.\r\nBAM!\r\nGolub's hairstyle is crazy \u2013 he\u2019s like the Yoda of comp sci. Don't underestimate his powers.\r\nAs soon as you walk through the door, the surrounding air temperature drops 30 degrees as you witness the epitome of the human race. A majestic white haired dude strides across the lecture hall and spreads his arms openly\u2013 with a devilish grin on his face \u2013 so fast you could have blinked and missed the moment of a lifetime. (I strongly advise bringing a camera to savor the moment)\r\nGolub E., or professionally known as \u201cEvan de Golub\u201d, is a retired super villain who now only uses his powers for forces of good\u2026.. for students of the CMSC major at the University of Maryland. He wears a silk vest every day - except on every other Friday. However, I personally felt like when he wasn't wearing the vest his lectures were more interesting and remained on topic. (Escalating theories in the scientific community that this very vest may have been part of his original super villain costume - and retains faint traces of pure evil.)\r\nHis vest is swaggy doe. Props to him.\r\nAlthough his receding hairline may fool you upon first glance, he has a magnificent pony tail and has the full-fledged back-head experience. But keep in mind he is no Lebron James. Golub is an extremely young person \u2013 his hair is only grey from an abundance of knowledge and sagacious wisdom he has accumulated throughout his career. (One, of course, which would take the average man many lifetimes to equal.) Golub is a young warrior, holding years of experience computer sciencing, playing wacky poker in the devious back rooms of mobster hideouts, taking photographs of people\u2019s feet and farm animals, and executing simulations of the mass genocide of pond fishies. But don\u2019t let me spoil the extravagant, Oscar-worthy backstory though. Let the Golub himself reveal it to you through his eloquent novel-worthy lectures which leave you hanging on an epic, thrilling cliff hanger after each 51 minute session. But don\u2019t worry my fellow Golub-goers, he always comes back the next week to continue the story almost where he left off, even after he has given tests that were not on the future topics he touched in the lectures \u2013 but on the stuff you should\u2019ve KNOWN ALL ALONG FROM THE START. Damn, this guy practically wrote Inception. (Before Christopher Nolan bought the rights to it.) \r\nAnyway, at first his lectures might seem pointless, spontaneous, random, unconnected, irrelevant, boring, and really confusing - but don\u2019t let that fool you.  In each session there is a small ten second topic that will become a pivotal test question somewhere down the road. Trust me. All of the spontaneous, random, unconnected, irrelevant, boring, and really confusing tangents he goes on are actually tests, testing the mental capacity of all 140 stude\u2013 I mean 45 students who bother to show up- in search for a new padawan. So if you want the prestigious position of \u201cGolub padawan\u201d on your resume, it\u2019s best you sign up right now and claim your first row seat.\r\nI strongly advise not bringing a computer to his lecture \u2013 this only distracts you from the true Golub-glorified experience. His signature hand gestures during his elegant lectures engage full houses of students \u2013 from all over the world- elevating them to the balls of their feet as he tells witty jokes that no one listens to. Seriously, one time someone almost let out a giggle and the whole universe practically collapsed inward upon itself and imploded. \r\nI suggest bringing the classic pen and notepad \u2013 which were the slim-lined computers Golub himself used when growing up in college \u2013 not those vintage clay tablets developed by the Mayans. (They\u2019re too intricate for the average man!) No matter which type of device you plan to bring, always stare at it and never make eye contact with the master while he speaks \u2013 this is a sign of challenge, an instinct Golub has picked up from his years chillin with lions and tigers and preforming weird combos to their portraits.\r\nGolub is a man with an infinite bag of tricks \u2013 did you know he was bilingual? Early on he\u2019ll amaze you with a programming project that no only asks you to prompt the user in English, but also in SPANISH?!!?! hhhhoooooowwwWWHHHHAAAAAAA?!!?!?! This man is a genius. You\u2019ll soon learn the concept of accounting for different cultural values and measurement systems because Golub exposes the flaws of NASA and unit conversions. During his reign as supervillain, Golub encountered the forces of NASA and recollects how the US measurement of distance was different that Europe\u2019s system, causing the NASA probe to crash (wasting the hundreds of millions of dollars Golub could have used for world domination). He references this story at least once every week, which now in hindsight, I think was a reoccurring subliminal message for comp sci students: don\u2019t trust NASA.\r\nNot only will you embark on pointless, unnecessary projects while other classes are sticking closer to reality, Golub will personally teach you the secrets to his mischievous trade of the wacky poker underground. His wacky poker project seemed too wacky for my taste, but then again, I was never playing a high stakes poker game with 300 zoo animals on the line. Golub is truly a modern superhero. When I took this class I never expected to learn essential life skills including: what Rwanda\u2019s flag looks like in 3 bit-resolution, how to do calculus in Martianese notation, how to program, or even the science behind a fish pond exploiting the true concepts of Darwinism. \r\nBut now I know, and I shall hold on to these precious gifts dearly as I move on with my life.\r\nIf you have been missing a real Bill Nye the science guy in your life, then this is the opportunity of a life time.

One thing to note about this class (which is perhaps why I found it easy) is that the material that you learn is actually extremely relevant to the field of computer science. If you tackle the material with that attitude you're bound to do much better in the class. I have had internship interview questions based on material learned in the class -- so learn the material any way that you can!\n\r\nThe only thing about Golub's class is that you need to be in lecture. You need to learn how he wants all of the problems' solutions to be set up -- exactly the way he does them in class. Do your best on homework and try to imitate his examples in lecture to get the best grade. Also, definitely do the thought questions -- get a study group. I can't stress this tip enough. His exams seemed to be based much more on the thought questions than the homework questions (how convenient..) -- and if you've done the thought questions, you're bound to ace the exam.\n\r\nGo to office hours if you are confused about something. He actually is very helpful in office hours (not necessarily in class), just make sure that you have notes from class because the first thing some of the TA's and Golub sometimes asks is \"okay, well lets look at your notes.\"\n\r\nIf you do miss a class make sure to get the notes from someone else. If you miss some classes you can still get away with an awesome grade, but if you miss even a single one of the classes where he discusses critical material, you're grade will drop like a rock unless you have access to someone else's notes.\n\r\nAll three of our midterms were pick 4 out of 5 questions. It was not this way in the past semesters (not for all 3 exams anyway) so don't bank on it, but it did make the class a hell of a lot easier.

For us, he changed it to 12% lowest midterm, 17% middle midterm, 22% best midterm, and for the homework section (which totalled 150 pts), he took the score out of 125 instead. \n\r\nHe also seems to curve exams arbitrarily..but everyone else has already touched on how he curves. Our first exam was taken out of 88 points, our second was 95, and third 97 or so. I would have expected a much higher curve for the second exam, which makes me wonder where he gets his numbers from (the 12 point curve on the first exam was unnecessarily high, but I'm not going to complain).\n\r\nAlso, the book is unnecessary.\n\r\nI would have given him 4 stars but if you try to ask him questions right after an exam even if it's unrelated, he will yell at you.

Personally, I went to his office hours once to explain how he did a certain proof, and he yelled at me, \"okay you are not doing this the way i mentioned in class, you have to pay attention!\" Forget about even asking any tangential questions, because he will automatically shoot down anything that's not related to the topic at hand. His default response: \"we're not talking about that. see me in office hours.\" Also if you approach him with your own problem and ask him to solve it, he refuses to do so out of concern that others won't get a chance to see the solution.\n\r\nAs other people have mentioned, he does not post up lecture notes or worked out examples, so you must attend class or get notes from someone else. the only good thing i have to say about the class is that his exams are reasonable and predictable; there is very little deviation from his homework and thought questions. Also, he is generous in that he allows you to answer 4 out of 5 questions and curves each exam score.

For example, on one exam we were told to divide our scores by .8. The problem with this curve is it gives MORE of a curve to people with higher grades...seeming to violate the point of a curve. Another time he gave everyone in the class 5 extra points as a \"curve\" but admitted that he had not yet calculated the average. He will intermittently claim that he has to \"recheck his formulas for final grades\"...so basically he leaves your grade as one of his thought questions.

The environment of the class completely revolved around his dislikeable centric personality. My group felt particularly terrorized in the sense that he seemed to be creating a climate of fear and instability all for the sake of flexing his perceived authority of the course topics. To expand on that, it's scary that he feels obliged to give some teams an F, and when he gives us the most abstract, ambiguous project guidelines I've ever seen in my entire life, with no examples of how we're supposed to follow them, it makes the grading feel completely unstable and up to chance. He seems oblivious to the possibility that there may be students in his class who have no experience in web development, or students with ADHD who can't sift through all his totally unstructured rules and instructions randomly spread across ELMS, lecture notes, and his personal website. Does he just think they're born to never succeed in his class and there's nothing anyone can do about it? Plus, his lectures are littered with irrelevant trivia about himself and his interests, which leaves behind an unsatisfying taste. He did express that he genuinely wants the best for his students, and I think there is some truth in that, but he clearly is too disconnected from the needs and desires of an average student to follow through on that. In a nutshell, professor Golub does way too much for an intro to UI class and he clearly can't comfortably handle everything he puts on his plate, which creates a vicious cycle where he lashes out by adapting an aggressive, unrealistic grading method to make himself feel comfortable again, and then his restored ego makes him inclined to put in even more effort.

To start off, his project descriptions are just one full page of text that's impossible to get any important information out of. Furthermore, the project guidelines are the most ambiguous and abstract guidelines I've ever seen. There are no examples to follow so it feels like you're always in fear of losing a ton of points. It's more than likely that you will do the assignment correctly but because of the confusing nature of the project descriptions, you will miss a few things that you needed to do. The purpose of organizing the project descriptions this way isn't to make it easy to do the assignment but instead, so Golub can have a valid excuse he takes enormous points off your assignment when you inevitably miss something. (I am talking about 25%+ for minor mistakes). \r\n\r\nThe second grip with this the professor, is his complete hatred of rubrics. If he had a rubric for his projects there it would be significantly more clear what he is looking for but since there is no rubric, no criteria to follow, and no examples of what he wants, you're basically going in blind and trying to follow the project descriptions as closely as possible. This would be fine if his grading wasn't so specific. There are things that he is specifically looking for but they won't be mentioned anywhere except for a passing sentence in the slides and are mentioned so quickly in the giant text of the project description. You'll have no idea what he wants until you get back your grades. \r\n\r\nThirdly, this might seem subjective but I am being completely honest when I say he is inconsistent with his grading. It's clear he picking and choosing points to take off and to keep on without reason. Two individuals could submit the same work and would get two entirely different results. Golub will take off different amounts of points for two individuals for entirely different reasons. It could be the same reason he will take off different amounts of points too. It's not even clear if he's doing this out of favoritism. And don't even bother trying to argue with him, since there's no rubric, there's nothing you can fight him on to get the points back. He'll come up with every excuse imaginable and sometimes even contradict himself in the process.\r\n\r\nFourthly, his classes are boring and irrelevant to the projects. He will spend hours on side tangents that have nothing to do with Human-Computer Interaction and won't even relate it back to the main topic. It's like he just wants to talk about it to show he is knowledgeable in that area. There are also attendance points discussed as participation points. They are given out at random so you basically have to come every day. His classes regularly go over the end of class and you always have to sit 5-7 minutes after when you're supposed to leave so he can wrap up class. You won't learn anything attending his classes and if you spend the entire class time on your phone, you wouldn't miss anything. \r\n\r\nNext, he is using way too many platforms. His slides and assignment on elms, we have to check our grades on the CS grade sever, he has his own website and to discuss our assignment with him on a separate Slack sever with 20 different channels. It's way too confusing and convoluted and he needs to condense the platforms he's using.\r\n\r\nFinally, towards the end of the course when other professors were wrapping up their courses to prepare for the final, Golub was still teaching new information. We had 3 midterms and 1 final exam and he was still teaching crucial new material that was going to be on the exam, one day before the final exam.
