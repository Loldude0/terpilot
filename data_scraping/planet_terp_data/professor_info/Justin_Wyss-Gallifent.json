Same goes for exam problems, besides the fact that you obviously do the exam independently, you can have a solution that follows the gradescope rubric to earn a specific amount of points, but the TA can be subjective and not go off of what the rubric says and even give you a 0 for the problem for what should have been partial credit atleast. This may be a TA problem sure, but Justin leads the TAs and instructs them on what to do, so I feel there's a bit on him too as he could make the rubrics for homework problems and exams more definitive so TAs can't be as subjective. Exam problems were ambiguous as well to an extent, mainly the true/false portion, but some written responses as well, but the true/false was only a few points (typically 10 points an exam).

TA's most of the time if you had something not resembling the rubric in a homework assignment, or just because based on their own judgement, will not take their time to read your answer and will not hesitate to slash off as many points as you can as possible (Many times I have gotten back as much as 20%-25% of my assignment just because the TA did not read my answer entirely, and I've had to explain very thoroughly in my regrades). \r\n\r\nI know this is not his fault, but he was very aware of the grading issue because we would get multiple announcements about how there would be over 100s of regrade requests for each assignment and exams. This would not be an issue if the grading was more careful in seeing if the student truly understands the topic instead of how close it is to the rubric, or even something as small if simplifying 1 more step would give the same answer. Oh and what the other reviewer below said is absolutely correct, sometimes I would compare homework answers after grades came out on grade scope, and classmates who wrote the exact same I did would get full credit while I would get -50% off or even the entire question wrong. Same thing if they had the same reasoning for more deep thought questions.  Mind you sometimes you would have to regrade this multiple times to get your points back if the TA's were unwilling to check, and it wasn't for sure that you would get your points back. \r\n\r\nLastly the reason that also made me give him a not so great review even though I enjoyed having him a lot as my instructor, the above issue of getting massive hundreds of regrades because of extremely inconsistent grading, got so bad that during the last weeks of school after the final they said that since regrade request numbers are always hundreds, they would not allow regrade requests for hw12,hw13 and the final exam. Our homework is worth 28% of our grade and people were relying on this to bring up their averages if they didn't drop them, and they even admitted they graded the hw \"leniently\" and the rubric would even say \"anything reasonable even if not correct\". My questions were not read, marked off points without explaining any reason because of the shortness of time with regrades from past assignments, and the final exam also had some grading inconsistencies.\r\n\r\nMy final point, Justin throughout the semester said that the cut-offs would be lowered  slightly below the regular cut offs to account for the grading inconsistencies, the ambiguous writing of questions on exams and etc. This was only 1% or so when confirming when my friends, which if I will be honest, 1% of the entire class is not enough to account to how extremely bad and up to the TA grading your assignments judgement is. And even if Justin offered to contact him regarding grading on hw12,hw13 and the final exam, he would only do this if you were borderline.

Engaging lectures, reasonable homework deadlines, mostly reasonable exams, etc.  However, I don't know if he's the best 250 professor.\r\n\r\nThe first section of the course was far too easy.  The concepts were simple, and the exam was easy (avg 90%).  I don't know if this was the best thing, as it may signal some to stop taking the class seriously (I know I did, which was a terrible decision).\r\n\r\nI don't know how I feel about the second section of the course.  This was set theory and proofs.  The lectures were effective in learning the material, but I feel like we could have gotten more practice beyond what was on the homeworks to really solidify the material.  For example, my thick skull didn't realize you could prove the two sides of a biconditional using different methods, so on the exam I tried proving both halves directly.  The homeworks given weren't enough to solidify the material in my brain.\r\n\r\nMy big issues with the course are in the third section.  I felt woefully unprepared for some of the content in this section.  Sums, products, and induction were fine (although it wasn't so cool that the sum formulas weren't provided on the final).  It's combinatorics where the major issues start to arise for me.  The range of combinatorics problems is much broader than anything else in the course, and I feel that Justin didn't prepare us very well on that front both in lecture examples and homework.  Admittedly, I don't understand the subject very well at all.  Regardless, after going through the homeworks, reading the solutions, and going through the final practice problems he posted towards the end, I just didn't feel prepared for what may have come on the final.  It felt like too little practice given how much there is to it.  I found probability a bit easier, but the problem remained that there was not as much practice as I would have liked on it.  Bayes Theorem is free though, granted I memorize the formula.  I don't feel that needed more.\r\n\r\nThe weekly groupworks should have been a potential remedy for this.  Unfortunately, they're not.  The questions, especially early on, could get extremely vague, which was unhelpful in learning the material.  Something about these ones didn't click in the same way as the groupworks I had in calc 3 did (I did not have Justin).\r\n\r\nA textbook was recommended, but without guidance on how to most effectively use it.  I don't know if I should have used it in retrospect, but it is what it is.\r\n\r\nOverall, do I recommend Justin for 250?  Absolutely.  He's Justin after all.

The grading for this course was Homework = 100, Coding = 200, Exams = 2x100 = 200, Final = 200, Total = 700. Your two lowest homework grades are dropped and your lowest coding grade was dropped (there were 6 projects in total). Homework was just testing your understanding of the data structures, including doing some proofs/calculations. Projects had you implement the data structures in Python with a possible slight twist, they weren't easy but they also weren't unreasonably difficult. All of the projects used public tests, so you knew your score immediately upon submission.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- The lectures were engaging and helpful. Justin explains things thoroughly and uploads his notes to ELMS.\r\n- As always, Justin's accompanying notes for this class are amazing. Always in full detail with rare mistakes, and contain everything you need to know for the homework, projects, and exams. If you want to take an early look at the course contents, just search up \"Justin cmsc420\" and you should find his notes.\r\n- Justin always had a review session before every exam. He explained all the concepts you needed to know for the exam, and provided a brief description of what each exam question would be about. I felt more than prepared for every single exam. The exams were fair, and he provided plenty of practice with the homework and past exams. Justin was also very lenient with project deadlines. He pushed them back if people said they wouldn't finish in time.\r\n- Grading was done pretty quickly, probably a week or so for exams. The median scores were always high (high 80s, low 90s) so there isn't much trouble there. No curve, but Justin says he bumps you if you are close.\r\n- His office hours were helpful, I only needed to go once though. The class also has a Piazza so you can ask questions there. Justin occasionally looks at Piazza, and the TAs were usually looking too.\r\n- The course content and projects are valuable and helpful for the future. Understanding data structures is important and I believe that I have a good understanding of many valuable data structures, their purposes, and how they are used.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- The only real con I have is that the final is cumulative. You have to remember a ton of content about the course, which can take a lot of prep time away from your other courses. However, you do get a notes sheet for the final, so my preparation basically just consisted of creating that notes sheet and doing all the problems from past exams. This was good enough to score well. We didn't cover all of the material in his notes, so there is some content that we missed. \r\n- People seem to say that the proofs are excessive, but I personally didn't find this to be true. The hardest proofs on the exams were basically just slight variations (or even exact copies) of proofs on the homework or the online notes. He also alludes to which proofs you need to know for the exams if you go to the lectures. If you understood why those work then you should not have a tough time. Generally speaking, yes you will be doing some amount of math but only as it applies to how the data structures work. If you seriously hate math that much, then yes maybe you are better off going to another professor. You will still have to do some form of math for this course, it's just how these data structures work.\r\n\r\nTaking this course was extremely valuable.
