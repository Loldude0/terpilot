This class may seem like a lot of work, but it is super manageable. There are readings due before class everyday, but you spend pretty much the entire class discussing, asking questions, and analyzing them. Aside from that there is no final exam, just a conversation with him or a Philosophy of Education Paper. Then along the way there is 4 analysis papers that are pretty spread out and you can write them on whatever you choose from the readings! Great class, Highly recommend Professor Scribner!", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2022-11-09T19:59:34.871068Z"}, {"professor": "Campbell Scribner", "course": "TLPL250", "review": "Understanding teacher and his classes are very interesting if you read the readings because you get to get philosophical.
