Do not get all the negative buzz around her. Lectures are very boring and I stopped going around third week. All HW assignments are free A's and you get two attempts. I learned everything for the midterm and final a week before and managed to pull out a B. If you apply yourself and do the work it will be easy to get an A.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "B", "created": "2023-12-18T05:41:34.664770Z"}, {"professor": "Stefania Scandizzo", "course": "ECON200", "review": "She posts the note for each class so you don't ever have to come to class in person. She goes over examples and releases practice tests and questions before each midterm. The two midterms are 20% each with the final being 30% of your grade. She covers different chapters than other sections so unless you have friends in your class, you can't study with anyone else. Although she doesn't curve, if you end with a 90 or above its a A. And a 88 or 89 is a A-. The smartbooks are helpful for learning content, and there are Guided Study Sessions weekly, as well as office hours which are helpful for questions.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-12-19T16:45:36.551546Z"}, {"professor": "Stefania Scandizzo", "course": "ECON200", "review": "Professor Scandizzo is a pretty good professor who explains concepts pretty well and makes it easy to understand what is happening. While the hws and smartbooks can be a lot of work during the week, they make it easier to understand the concepts. Her tests are fair and she provides helpful resources and practice problems to better prepare you for the exams. There are 2 midterms and a final that make up a majority of your grade. ECON200 also has weekly GSS sessions and a tutoring center that allows you to get help multiple times a week which is helpful. I recommend attending class as concepts are easier to understand when she explains them but she does post the slides if you need to go over them again.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-12-19T19:50:56.388334Z"}, {"professor": "Stefania Scandizzo", "course": "ECON200", "review": "I think she teaches the course pretty well and straight-forward.
