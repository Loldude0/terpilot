Her teaching methods were so fun and helpful! She gave us alot of practice homework BUT it helped us review for the exams and such. We also had alot of quizzes, but don't freak out because it was pretty easy IF you studied. And PLEASE study for her class. Honestly, her exams and quizzes are set up just like the study guides and practice homeworks etc. ALSO if you are confused just go to her office hours! She is so easy to approach and not scary at all! Also the TA's are great. Anton (and Bleam) helped me out with alot of questions I had about the homework and helped me understand better alot of concepts I did not fully understand. Overall, Bleam is a fun, energetic,and well prepared Professor.

She is very nice as a professor. The only downfall I see to this course is that even though you may understand something fully, you can still fail a quiz if you don't understand her format. The test are well put together, just watch out for the multiple choice. I also think there are too many exercises, there were times when I felt like I needed a break. It's like you relive the high school experience of homework, but they do help you learn. Other than those few things, you will learn a lot from this course.

Dr. Bleam is an amazing professor and LING240 is such an interesting class! She's an excellent teacher and her lectures are engaging and helpful. You will need to read articles/studies/experiments for this class but they are always interesting and understandable. The exams match material discussed in lectures and on exercises and homeworks, both in content and difficulty. They definitely supplemented my learning and did not feel like busywork or a waste of time. \r\nI honestly found the class to be easy and scored very well on the assignments and exams with minimal effort. HOWEVER, my classmates said they found the exams to be somewhat difficult and that the TAs were picky graders, so maybe it depends on whether or not you have a knack for this kind of thing. Either way, getting an A or B is totally doable if you are willing to put in at least a moderate amount of effort. My best piece of advice is to take notes during class AND on the readings. Nothing exhaustive but make sure you have all the key points and some examples. \r\nI highly recommend this class, especially if you're genuinely interested in linguistics.

Some of the content is interesting and enjoyable, other parts of it are tedious and annoying to solve without the IPA. Overall it isn't the worst if you put in a good amount of effort. \r\n\r\nProfessor Bleam is a good professor, it's the course content which i have a problem with. I expected the content to be solely focused on the theoretical and philosophical side of linguistics. It turns out this class was largely dominated by the International Phonetic alphabet and the scientific and technical side of linguistics. This was annoying because it takes a good amount of extra time to try to understand these concepts in addition to memorizing the IPA, which is something they required us to do. The memorization aspect really was just extra work as we could have grasped the concepts without struggling through the memorization. I went to almost every discussion section and lecture and i still found it so tedious to have to learn how to do the exercises. The topic isn't hard and I basically got the hang of it by the final, but the content/exercises were made unnecessarily hard by the memorization. Doing the out of class readings doesn't explain a whole lot either. You need to go to office hours and do some practice to understand. With this i will say that the homework assignments did help. My discussion section on the other hand was largely a waste of time. If they had provided us with a sheet detailing the IPA on tests, then the class average would have been much higher and in my personal experience I would have understood how to do the practice exercises better and much earlier on in the course.
