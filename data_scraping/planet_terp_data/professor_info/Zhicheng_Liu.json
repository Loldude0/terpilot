Spent an entire month giving \"special topics lectures\" as an excuse not to teach. His TA did all of the grading of the ridiculous, half-baked programming projects with the incredibly buggy D3 library. Aside from being entirely arbitrary in the grading, she was slow in doing so. Not much better than the actual prof. The final group project is a tremendous waste of time with extremely unclear objectives and arbitrary grading criteria. This isn't sour grapes either, I earned an A without really trying. But did I actually learn anything in the course? No, absolutely not. Zhicheng was poached from Adobe if my memory is correct; the University of Maryland would do well to send him right back.", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2024-02-05T17:09:14.648337Z"}], "name": "Zhicheng Liu", "slug": "liu_zhicheng"}
