The in-class discussions are very meaningful and super interesting. The amount of feedback she takes and applies makes sure that the course focuses on the areas that students are interested in and make you feel seen. The class work is related to the themes and questions asked throughout the semester and isn't busywork.

Like just don't take it. Its a dumb course. She made us make lesson plans, which seemed pointless. everything beside viewing assignment and reading response is absolute shit. STAY AWAY. Teacher is supernice. she is super strict. if you miss an assignment it would probably drop your grade by at least 4-5%. killing you in the end. there are no make ups or extra credit. If you miss classes, she would tend to give u a worse score no matter what. it does depend on her mood ngl.", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "B-", "created": "2023-12-23T18:42:53.778891Z"}], "name": "Katryna Andrusik", "slug": "andrusik"}
