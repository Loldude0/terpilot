This IS a science course - you're not going to be getting an A+ from just spending 20 minutes per week on it.  If you come to class (mandatory anyway), actually try, and be as interested as you can, you're going to feel like you got a lot out of it.\n\r\nDr. Hayes-Gehrke is very nice and a good speaker.  She's knowledgeable and keeps everyone involved during class.\n\r\n-----\n\r\nThe rest of this review is what to expect from ASTR220 with her teaching:\n\r\nThere's pre-lecture videos (anywhere from 20-45 minutes generally) followed by a quick multiple choice quiz.  TAKE NOTES WHILE WATCHING THE VIDEOS!!  You will be hating life later if you don't because you'll have no notes to study from for the exams.  I had groupmates that took zero notes and were complaining about having to watch the videos again to study for the exam.  These are your homework (alongside projects).  No textbook.\n\r\nThe pre-lecture videos prevent you from being lectured during class.  Instead, you're going to be doing rapid fire multiple choice questions, class discussions on the topics, and a calculation here and there with your groups.  She does this to prevent the typical \"lecture until you're bored\" style of class, and it works in my opinion.\n\r\nSpeaking of groupmates...you will have them for the entire semester.  You're going to be assigned them in the beginning of the semester - some you will be ok with, some you will dislike.  Learn to get along and distribute work instead of complaining, and your life will be a lot easier.  Use Google Docs to get your work done, add comments to papers, etc. to make your life so much easier.  Set deadlines, and start early!  If you follow those guidelines, you'll never receive less than an A on the projects.  And if anyone isn't pulling their weight, you get to grade your teammates based on work effort after the project is submitted.\n\r\nYou'll have multiple projects:  \r\n1)  a research paper about a specific asteroid\r\n2)  a poster (large powerpoint slide) project on a random astronomy topic/event, which you'll have printed and present to multiple people/groups\r\n3)  a paper where you design a spacecraft to accomplish a specific goal/mission\r\n4)  a debate (group vs group) about a random topic that you'll do in front of the class\r\nThese projects span across weeks, giving you tons of time to take your time on them and not make you feel overwhelmed.  I do feel that projects were graded a little harshly though.  They weren't unfair, but it just seemed that we lost a few points here or there for minor things, which was making it impossible to get the A instead of A- or B+.  \n\r\nThe grading also seemed to get MUCH harsher as the semester went on.  I felt that she was being overly picky on many aspects of grading projects and exams towards the end of the semester, especially given how busy you are juggling all of your classes.\n\r\nTwo midterms, which are average difficulty (35 multiple choice questions that are exactly like the in-class multiple choice questions she posts on the slides) and 6 or so short answer questions (sometimes involving a quick calculation or explanation).  Equations are provided, you'll just be expected to understand concepts like \"If this asteroid has properties A, B, and C, and I do \"this\" to it, what will happen?\"  You get re-tests though:  You take the exam, and then you get another week or so to take the exact exam at home with all of your resources, classmates, etc. and bring it back in.  Your score will be the average of the two scores, and any additional points that you got from your average compared to your original score will be added as bonus points to your final exam score (since there's no re-test for the final).  i.e. if you got a 90, then re-test you got a 100, your average score is 95.  So 5 points are added to your final exam score.  Final exam was all essay/short answer questions.  Felt easy after finishing, but the grade was A LOT lower than I expected, again due to extremely nit-picky grading.\n\r\nDiscussion section is fine.  We had to get an assignment done each time (pretty easy) and just go over with our groupmates what we're doing/any progress on projects and such.  It's what you would expect.\n\r\nExcluding studying for exams, you'll likely spend about 2-4 hours per week on this class (1-2 hours on pre-lecture stuff and another 1-2 hours on projects, depending on how hard you're working).  Overall, most people learned a ton from this course and want to take ASTR315 with her next semester (and are considering Astronomy minors).

She's clear,  patient with students, and open to student concerns and questions.\n\r\nWith that said, the workload for the number of credits that the course is worth is absolutely atrocious. In terms of what I'd consider to be assignments done out of class, there were \"Pre-Lecture Quizzes\" for nearly every lecture, \"Homework\" assignments for which there were 5, and \"Projects\" for which there were 3. \n\r\nThe \"Pre-Lecture Quizzes\" are exactly as they sound like and take about 30 minutes each to complete. \"HW\" assignments could very easily be called projects in any other classes as they were fairly difficult and took a significant amount of time (upwards of 4 hours each). The 3 \"Projects\" we were assigned were even worse in terms of difficulty and time required for completion, and the last of the projects could well be considered 2 projects with a single due date. Any one of these 4 assignments would constitute a \"Final Project\" in another class.\n\r\nAnother caveat of the class is group work. You have to make resumes to post online to your classmates, against your classmates so that you can hurry and make fairly permanent groups in 10 minute scramble. This group is probably going to be with you for the rest of the semester working on each project. This can be both a good and a bad thing, as it's encouraged that you work with classmates on the HW assignments. Having a group you're comfortable with can make the HW process easier, but you're also stuck with them for 4 months. \n\r\nI've definitely learned a significant amount in this course, but not nearly as much as the work requirement should indicate.

Imagine teaching yourself and then coming to class and being quizzed everyday --- this is astr100 in a nutshell. Mind you, the grading in this course is insanely harsh.  I am a physics major taking this course for a minor and I was completely floored by the grades I was receiving in this class. She asks incredibly specific questions that ask you to apply what you know (often times trying to trick you) and will not hesitate to give you a 0/5 for a less than perfect answer. Her questions are sometimes so watered down and baby-ish that you will actually get them wrong just by second-guessing yourself. I loved astronomy before this but this professor has been incredibly frustrating.

Her classes are very interesting though, so I recommend just going to them.\n\r\nThe biggest downfall to this class is probably the group work.  There is a lot of it.  You usually end up doing a little group worksheet in most discussions, and there is a large \"poster project\" at the end of the semester that you must do in a group of around four.

Like others have said, she talks to you like your a kid and babys you through every single activity, but that only slightly takes away from her overall success as a lecturer. She really knows her stuff. \n\r\nThe work, however is a different story. Before every single lecture, she posts mandatory \"prelecture\" videos that are often more than 30mins long. This can be super annoying. However, I find that I can skip through the videos in 5-10mins and still get a 100 on the quizzes. \n\r\nShe is really a stickler on grading group projects. She takes points off in random places and I often found myself getting Bs when i thought i deserved at least an A-.\n\r\nThe one redeeming quality to the coursework is the exams. They are a complete joke. The way she works it is that you go to the exam and take it, and when youre done you pick up a second copy of the exam which you take home and complete with youre notes. You hand in the second copy and she averages the two grades together! You really have to be an idiot to get less than a B on the exams because what ever grade you get is averaged with a 100 (which I got on both midterm ReTests). \n\r\nOverall, the class can be kind of annoying sometimes, but I think the material is interesting and it really doesnt take that much effort to get a good grade.

At the beginning of the course I thought it was a huge relief, since I'm sick of being held to a stupidly high standard in so many of my courses. After a while it became kind of annoying, and then frustrating since there was a stark contrast between how she spoke and what she expected of us in some projects, like the research poster. By the end of the course I began to appreciate it again. I don't think she does it to be demeaning, I think she is just a very kind and caring person to the point of sometimes sounding like a kindergarten teacher.\n\r\nIn the end I did well and learned a ton.

There is a \"retest\" paper in all three midterms where you boost your score by doing the same exam you did the classroom now at home.

Honestly, this can get pretty annoying if you have a head on your shoulders as there were a couple of people in my class who would literally ask her a question that she had just explained thoroughly and she would jump right in without a thought (and waste time).\n\r\n2) As implicitly stated above, she likes to baby her students. She takes attendance, has mandatory rough draft editing for papers and never, ever refrains from answering a terrible question.\n\r\n3) This might sound harsh, but she's a fairly poor quiz/exam writer. She has a tendency to say something in class and then put an oddly worded question on an online quiz that correlates to what she said but has a slightly different answer than what you'd expect based on her wording. Her exam questions are also pretty tricky.\n\r\n4) This is the most important point of all: She somehow manages to make the class very interesting from start to finish. I think it's her delivery style but I had little trouble in following her throughout the entire lecture (unless I was exhausted). She definitely made this course a fun experience for me.\n\r\nBased on all of the above I recommend taking ASTR220 with Dr. Hayes-Gehrke.

The way this class is currently structured is also really nice. I took this class once before, and it has really been streamlined since then. The textbook has been scrapped, and has been replaced by online \"pre-lecture summaries\" and \"pre-lecture quizzes\". All you gotta do is watch the pre-lecture summary and then take the 8-point or so multiple choice quiz. Sounds easy enough, but it can get aggravating when the pre-lectures are easily as long as the in-class lectures themselves. Plus you gotta do the darn things three times a week. On top of that, each in-class lecture is followed by an online \"post-lecture summary\" that is related to the lecture material, but oftentimes requires you to think outside the box more.\n\r\nThe exams are also easy (I can't say much about the final, I haven't taken that yet). The attendance policy is forgiving and the lectures are by no means boring. You can tell Ms. Hayes - Gerhke is really trying to find the \"perfect formula\" for getting students to remember information. \n\r\nOne thing I wish she would stop doing is treating the class like little kids. She has a habit of stating something that is blatantly wrong, then asking \"do you agree? Or... is that not the case?\" or something to that effect. Then she waits for people to say WHY her statement is incorrect, and all the while people just sit there going \"durr... do we really have to spell it out for you? Again?\". It might just be another weapon in her arsenal of learning techniques (specifically, the weapon of mindless repetition), and if it is, I don't like it. The flash cards she uses are also kind of lame.

I got 3 out of 10 points taken off my answer to one question because I forgot to include the words \"low density.\" \n\r\nAlso, the 2 times I communicated with her, once via email and once in her office, she seemed very snippy and not that willing to help.
