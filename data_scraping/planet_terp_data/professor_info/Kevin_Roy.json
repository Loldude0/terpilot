Ok, maybe not. \r\nBut FMSC381 with Dr. Roy *was* one of my favorite classes of college - it opened me eyes to so many new aspects of our society that I was simply unexposed to for the first 20+ years of my life. \r\nAlso, Professor Roy is just a great lecturer. He brings in a lot of statistics and relevant, practical examples that really highlight the points he is trying to convey through out the course, Plus, he really keeps your attention, if you know what I mean. The only downside of the class is that it's at 9am. But honestly - it's worth it. \r\nThere are a bunch of assignments and papers, but they are all very doable if you give yourself enough time. Also, Dr. Roy is a very fair grader, so if you put in the work, you'll likely do well.\n\r\nA genuinely sweet professor, really interesting course content, and a class that changed my outlook forever.
