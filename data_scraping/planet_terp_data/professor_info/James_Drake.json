Dr. Drake is a great professor when it comes to going out of his way for his students. He is always more than willing to schedule time to meet with you to discuss homeworks/concepts/exams.

Sorry guys, you can't plug and chug your way out of this class. If you can grasps the concepts then you'll be fine but if you are more of a numbers person than you might want to consider a different professor or put in the effort to understand the theory and logic. His exams are somewhat similar to his sample exams and there are really no surprises. He also makes sure it's graded where you get the maximum partial credit. ie. if you get part a wrong and part b needs the solution to part a, you can still get full credit for part b using part a granted that you follow the correct steps.\r\n\r\nThis semester the physics department really screwed over everyone with suddenly changing the curriculum causing professors to change their lecture materials.

When he teaches his material it can be confusing, after almost every lecture I would have no idea what is going on but the key part about his class that made me get an A is that before each midterm and the final he would have a review session where he went over in depth the practice exam. So I would just memorize how to do the practice exam and understand the concepts on the practice exam and then I would do well on the midterms as the midterms were almost exactly the same but different questions. The homeworks are really hard and useless (I just found the answer key online and never really understood most of the hws and still got an A).
