This class is definitely more chill, so if you want an easy A, I would suggest this course.  His classes are definitely more discussion-based, and hardly any lecture-type style.  A common downside to this is that I would say most classes seem dead since hardly everyone is super engaged.  There is a decent amount of reading, so be ready for that.  Most of the effort in this class should be dedicated to the readings and essays, and you'll do great :)", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2022-12-20T14:02:50.583158Z"}], "name": "James Rankin", "slug": "rankin"}
