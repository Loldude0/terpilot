After that, I did not improve much, especially on topics like trees and graphs and dynamic programming.\r\n\r\nIt's not a course that starts from scratch and slowly teaches you everything there is about Leetcode problems. If you know nothing, at most, you'll learn how to solve some array and string problems. As for the rest, you get out of it what you put into it, i.e. it depends on how much you personally practice Leetcode, which has nothing to do with the course.\r\n\r\nDespite learning little, I got an A, because the exams and homeworks are easier.\r\n\r\nConclusion: take the course if you want an introduction to Leetcode, but don't expect to learn a lot just from the course itself.", "rating": 2, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-05-12T01:21:28.669335Z"}, {"professor": "Thomas Goldstein", "course": "CMSC389O", "review": "Fully TA taught.
