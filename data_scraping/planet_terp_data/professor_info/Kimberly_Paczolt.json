Her class isn't curved, but she did offer a lot of opportunities for extra credit throughout the semester and even on the final exam. We had three exams and each also had about 4 extra credit points possible which was nice. The exam averages tended to be in the high 60s (MC and short answer) and the final average was in the mid-70s (all MC). You do have to put in a decent amount of studying time to be able to learn, understand, and memorize all of the material that will be on the test, so I'd recommend starting about a week in advance. For the short answer questions on the exams, you basically either know it or you don't which can get difficult. The wording on some of her multiple-choice questions can get confusing, so I definitely recommend taking the practice exams she posts to try to get used to it.\r\n\r\nThe weekly 2-hour discussions are mandatory, but for the two weeks of discussion that lead up to each exam, you have dedicated exam review time where the TA goes over the important topics that will be covered on the exam in a PowerPoint. In the other weeks of discussion, you do something called GeneLab where you research a gene related to some kind of condition, which is a little tedious because it takes some time, but it's not that hard and it has a lot of easy points. Because discussions are two hours, it can feel extremely long sometimes which sucks, but it's not the worst thing ever.\r\n\r\nHer lectures can get a little bit boring because it's mainly her talking about the lecture slides, but she does post recordings on ELMS if you miss one or miss something important she says. One thing that would get a little frustrating is that sometimes she'll say important things but not have them on the slides, so it would feel like I'm trying to transcribe everything she's saying. Because of this, I recommend studying from the topic outlines she posts on ELMS rather than using the lecture slides because the outlines have things more written out than her slides do.\r\n\r\nShe has topic quizzes on ELMS due about every week about each topic you learn in lecture, and they can get a little difficult sometimes but she gives a lot of time to take them.

There is some extra credit on every exam, and if there was a low exam average she might give out more. The free response is tricky, you need to include certain key words/phrases to get points but it's not explicitly stated what those phrases are. The exams are based on what she says during lecture - I got a good grade because I basically copied down every word she said and studied it (which is why the lecture recordings are so helpful). If she mentions a small detail you think is irrelevant, it will probably be a question on the next exam. Discussion includes two weeks of exam review for every exam, which honestly is very helpful. The final is cumulative but is made up of slightly altered versions of the questions from the midterms, so it is easier to study for it. It is also all multiple choice. Most assignments are graded based on correctness - homework, quizzes, genelab, etc., and I found the topic quizzes and homework questions tricky at times (I literally never got full points on a homework assignment even though it isn't timed lol). Study plans and practice exams are graded on completion though!", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-12-15T21:13:46.420164Z"}, {"professor": "Kimberly Paczolt", "course": "BSCI222", "review": "BSCI222 is an information-packed class and it can be hard to keep up with the content. However, Dr. Paczolt gives you plenty of resources for you to be able to succeed. She posts her lecture recordings, has very helpful topic outlines, posts a practice exam before every midterm, is great at answering questions in class or during office hours, and keeps up with discussion board questions. She even holds an extra office hour before exams. Some other reviews referred to her lectures as an information dump, but that's just because there is so much content to cover that Dr. Paczolt has to keep to a strict schedule to finish everything before the semester ends. I actually liked her lecture style; she spoke clearly and was very thorough in explaining the content. Her lecture recordings are especially helpful for catching the details you may have missed the first time around. \r\n\r\nThe coursework was not too overwhelming; she assigned a topic quiz to be completed after each topic (4 topics per midterm), and 2 homework assignments and a practice exam due before each midterm. There was also an occasional short MathBench or 222torial Quiz due. The practice exam was graded on completion, but all others were on accuracy, and every one of these assignments was take-home and online. All of these assignments are useful in preparing for her exam as they showcase the types of questions included in her exams. Her exam grading is fair and she gives out plenty of extra credit to boost your grade. I've heard from my classmates that time can be tight on the midterms, but I feel like if you know the content well, they are completely doable within the timeframe. Her final is all multiple-choice and easier than the midterms, so time shouldn't be an issue there.\r\n\r\nDiscussion sessions could be split into Gene Labs and Exam Review and they are all mandatory. The Gene Labs were interesting and allowed you to see the applications of the content learned in lecture, but weren't particularly helpful for learning the content itself. The exam review sessions were a great way to prepare for exams though.\r\n\r\nHow I studied: Before each topic quiz, I would rewatch the lecture recordings for that topic at double speed. For the homework assignments, I would go through it once closed-note, then go through it again open-note and mark down what I got wrong before submitting. I always checked my practice exam against the practice exam keys and marked down what I got wrong. Before midterms/finals, I would read over the topic outlines and review the quizzes/homeworks covered in that exam. The topic outlines are extremely helpful when preparing for the exams. Flashcards would also be useful since there are a lot of terms to remember. Other helpful resources would be GSS and the discussion review slides.  On average, I'd say I spent 2-3 hours per week on coursework and 10 hours per midterm studying.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-12-16T03:18:06.322294Z"}, {"professor": "Kimberly Paczolt", "course": "BSCI222", "review": "All the reviews here are horribly unfair. If you put in an adequate amount of work, you will be fine. The class is expectedly dense, but that is the nature of Genetics as a topic, and less so indicative of the professor itself. She provides enough material to be successful, and the exams are very fair. Study hard!! The exam format is not bad, and there is no essay writing or anything like that. She always provides bonuses on her exams as well, which sometimes are just free points. Discussion is a little unrelated, but overall not hard either.
