He is a great teacher who is laid back yet manages to get his teaching points across. The class was designed to mimic what a student would do in Law School, and I felt that it does a good job at giving you a sense of what to expect to do in law school and if it is a career that is right for you. Although Professor Amos's instructions were a bit vague at times, he is very reasonable on grading, so that made up for it.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-05-22T16:01:40.421083Z"}], "name": "Esthus Amos", "slug": "amos_esthus"}
