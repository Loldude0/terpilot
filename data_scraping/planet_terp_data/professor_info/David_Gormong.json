We have 5 total speeches (4 individual, 1 group - tho this speech was a breeze). While he knows his stuff, he is kind of boring. He does not post his PowerPoint online as he believes this will cause students to slack off in his class. You are expected to take notes by hand unless you are excused by UMD to use an electronic device. What I found most annoying was two things. He gives pop quizzes on the occasion and while they are worth 5 points, they can be unexpected and hurt your grade a little bit. The other thing is that when you are giving a speech, and you go even a second above or below the time limit, he will deduct 3 points from your final grade. If you are giving a speech worth 50 points, those 3 points mean the difference between a letter grade. Plus when you are giving a speech, you have no way of knowing the time so you really have to practice to get within a certain time frame. I will say, he did not grade that harshly on speeches and he is approachable if you have a problem. He is a nice professor and you will learn a lot in this class. You get weekly reading quizzes which aren't too difficult, and a weekly video response which if you put the minimal work in on those, you will get 5/5. There are definitely better professors out there for this course, but Professor Gormong is new so he is getting used to the culture here at UMD.

You can tell that he's very passionate and enthusiastic about the subject that he teaches. If a professor hates their job, the students probably will hate the subject.\r\n3.) His assignments are very easy.\r\n4.) Lenient on grades for speeches. \r\n5.)

Speeches are worth 60% of your grade so if something random occurs and you miss any...you're pretty much doomed. I know this class is supposed to prepare you for public speaking, but even 40% would be reasonable. The midterm and final need to be worth WAY more. Or maybe he can incorporate other assignments...for example projects. \r\n2.) Though his assignments are easy, with other classes college can be overwhelming. There is no leeway for late work at all. You don't even get 50% of the credit. \r\n3.) I never understood why we couldn't have electronics in class (even for notes). We're adults.

I feel like someone else perfectly summarized his teaching style but let me reiterate that he is new and because of this I feel like it is the reason for why he is so strict on following the curriculum to a tee. One thing that did make me hesitate to give him a higher score was that he does give pop quizzes sometimes, although on some of them, he allows you to collaborate with your fellow peers. However, twice he gave a matching quiz and once you get one wrong, you basically get two wrong and these five points, although small, can have a huge impact on someone's grade. I feel that he is a lot more harsh than some of the other INAG professors I've heard about from my friends when it comes to grading your speeches. He really cares about your movements in your speech, along with your hand gestures and make sure you practice at least two nights in advance because he will take off points if you look at your note cards too much. Other than the speeches, I feel that the other assignments are just busy work and can be completed in thirty minutes or less. He doesn't allow electronics but people in my class constantly go on their phones and he doesn't say much about it (this didn't really bother me because I have other classes that also don't allow electronics but it might be an issue for someone who doesn't like to write out their notes). He really does care about his students and their opinions but also just making sure that all of us understand the content that he is presenting. As long as you work hard, prepare well for each speech, and listen to/attend class lectures (also he does not post his powerpoint slides or recordings of his class lecture because he thinks this will make his students think they can just skip his class), it should be easy to get an A in his class.

His midterm and finals were also both LockDown browser, closed-book, and made us come in-person for it while other profs allowed you to take it home and open-note. If you take INAG with him, you actually have to put in a little more effort than if you were to take the other profs so if you were looking for an extremely easy A, take any other professor. Other than that, it is very doable to get an A with him as long as you use gestures (he takes those super seriously) and practice your speech often.

The way he grades is directly out of the book and he doesn't let anything slip. Also when you go to ask him a question about the grading he gets super defensive and almost rude. He gives a lot of homework throughout the semester, but don't get me wrong it's easy homework. For the amount of homework he gives there is almost like no point because it doesn't effect your grade at all. The midterms and finals are dumb because you have to take them in person and with a lock down browser, when you should be able to take those online and not in class because that's what other professors do. Overall, he is a nice person but a tougher grader for an oral communications class that is just supposed to be an easy GenEd. I mean in my opinion everyone should be getting a 85+ automatically if they are getting in front of the room and talking about the topic.
