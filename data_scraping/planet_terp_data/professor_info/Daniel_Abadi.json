You will learn a fair amount about SQL and using DBMS properly, but even more about the in depth technical details of designing databases. The first half of the class is straightforward and fun, learning about writing SQL queries and E/R models. Midterm was pretty easy if you paid attention. The material gets very very difficult towards the end of the semester. Reading quizzes get hard as the semester goes on. The projects become very time consuming and somewhat confusing as well. As always, if you start early, they are doable. Final was egregiously hard, but Dr Abadi informed us that there was a mistake made regarding the difficulty level. A quite substantial curve was provided on the final exam. Overall, would recommend, but be ready for a moderately heavy workload at times.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "B", "created": "2023-05-20T03:22:21.350692Z"}, {"professor": "Daniel Abadi", "course": "CMSC424", "review": "Incredibly knowledgeable about databases.

Did you find the exams and major assignments fair? \r\n\u00b7 The reading quizzes are connected to the readings, but some questions can be tricky and require close attention. \r\n\u00b7 Clicker questions are free as long as someone provides a reasonable justification during class. \r\n\u00b7 The midterm exam was fair. The final exam was challenging but had a significant curve (20%). \r\n\u00b7 The projects were manageable, taking about 10 hours each. The last two projects are based on Berkeley's database class and require understanding the existing codebase before applying class concepts.\r\n\u00b7 The breakdown was projects (32%), midterm (20%), final (32%), clickers (8%), and reading quizzes (8%). \r\n\u2014\r\n2. Did you feel the professor had reasonable expectations for the students in the course overall? \r\n\u00b7 Yes. There were reading quizzes almost every week. Clicker questions were challenging but thought-provoking. Exams were reasonable. Participating during class and answering non-trivial questions was expected. Fair application of what we cover in the textbook and class.\r\n\u2014\r\n3. Did you like the professor's teaching style?\r\n\u00b7 I enjoyed the professor's teaching style as he provided clear guidance on how to prepare for and succeed in the course.\r\n\u00b7 He offered ample practice problems, gave advice on studying for exams, and emphasized hands-on practice. The midterm heavily focused on the projects. \r\n\u00b7 What I particularly enjoyed was the professor's dedication to creating a positive classroom culture. He made an effort to personalize interactions by remembering and using our names. He encouraged questions and fostered discussions. It was evident that he cared deeply about the subject matter and his students. His enthusiasm was reflected in his attire as well, as he wore a suit to every class. Very caring.\r\n\u2014\r\n4. Was the workload appropriate for the number of credits? \r\n\u00b7 The workload was appropriate but slightly heavy, considering 17 reading quizzes (approximately 1.5 hours each), 4 projects (each taking 10 hours), and 2 exams (requiring 10 hours of study each). \r\n\u2014\r\n5. Was this course valuable or a waste of time? \r\n\u00b7 This course is highly valuable, especially for those interested in software engineering and data science/machine learning. Interacting with databases is a crucial skill in various careers.  He emphasized making 424 practical rather than overly theoretical. \r\n\u00b7 The first half of course covers advanced SQL, ER diagrams, schemas, normalization, and database building components. The second half focuses on theoretical aspects, considering memory constraints and algorithm costs. Cost considerations of queries was one of my favorite topics. B-trees are a significant topic as well. \r\n\u00b7 Projects 3 and 4 provide excellent practice working with large existing codebases. \r\n\u00b7 The TA's (Pooja, Cuong) contribute to the positive learning experience.\r\n\u2014\r\n6. How much support did you receive throughout the semester (office hours, extra resources, etc.)?\r\n\u00b7 Four hours of TA office hours were available each week, and the TAs were responsive to Piazza and willing to provide assistance with code privately.\r\n\u00b7 The professor had office hours by appointment (after class) and was always willing to explain clicker and reading quiz questions. \r\n\u00b7 He offered a bonus project to raise project grades and had a generous project late penalty.\r\n\u00b7 Three reading quizzes and three clickers were dropped. \r\n\u00b7 While the professor sometimes spoke quickly and didn't record classes, the classroom culture, energy, and support were excellent. Attendance was required. \r\n\u2014\r\n7. TLDR Weekly reading quizzes, clicker questions, mandatory attendance, relevant concepts, fair projects and exams, exceptionally caring and intelligent professor who encourages participation during class. Decent workload, but this is my favorite CS class at UMD. I highly recommend it with Abadi.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-08-26T00:20:10.588760Z"}], "name": "Daniel Abadi", "slug": "abadi_daniel"}
