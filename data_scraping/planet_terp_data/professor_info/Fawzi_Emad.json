The biggest problem students have with the projects is not figuring out what to do...it's actually completing the project on time.

Moreover, the teacher assistants are super helpful: I can't make it in his class without their support, especially when it's for coding projects and reviewing for midterms (they make review slides and coding examples in my semester, and I hope the next TA will do that too). I never have an office hour with Fawzi, but the TAs are more than enough (he recruits amazing ones). \r\n\r\nThere are 3 advices to give to new students who take his class:\r\n1. DO NOT SKIP CLASS! Fawzi posts lecture slides but most are similar to outlines. To truly understand it, it's better to attend classes and see his thinking processes with examples and drawings. He is strict with time, so he prioritizes delivering all the contents he has for the lecture first then asking questions second.\r\n2. START PROJECTS EARLY! The day Fawzi posts the announcement that the next project is available is the day you should start right away! The TAs are there to help you. Immediately go to them if you don't know how to start. Don't wait until the last 4 days, unless you love being in a long queue of ~20 students (each takes like 5 minutes, give or take another 5).\r\n3. REVIEW LECTURES WEEKLY! Fawzi usually gives weekly quizzes and it's a good way to know what you need to review for midterms. I regret that I didn't do this weekly, which gave me lots of stress the day before the quiz or exam. This not only maintains good scores for all assignments during the semester but also helps you solidify your understanding of all contents for the final.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- Great lectures (easy and clear to understand, good examples)\r\n- Fair exams (what you have learned)\r\n- Supportive, friendly, and super helpful TAs\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Exams: because he tests all of what you have learned (some topics appears a lot and some only appears once), you have no idea what will worth lots of points. You study EVERYTHING, which is just ... a lot.\r\n- He doesn't record lectures (maybe once or twice if it's Friday before a holiday weekend).\r\n- Optional: \"nerds\" who ask a lot of advanced questions at the front and interrupts the lectures.\r\n\r\nPS: I failed the final (D), but all other assignments were high (B+).

If you are confused, try to debug the code yourself before seeing a TA.\r\n2) Attending Lectures! Fawzi's lectures are usually entertaining, but he knows when the content is boring and when students like to skip. Sometimes he will give you the topics for the quizzes and coding tricks. \r\n3) Attending Discussions! Discussions usually focus on coding and other technical things which are tested or used in a project. It's in your best interest to show up, do the lab, and ask for help.

(NOTE: I had Nelson first semester and received a very good grade so 132 with Fawzi was a shock. I have completed the course but chose to leave it optional out of confidentiality).\r\n\r\nFawzi is too fast paced in lecture. On top of that his powerpoint are next to useless and he doesn't record lectures. On top of that he doesn't give fair exams in my opinion. I will admit the midterms were fair, but they test the smallest details which you wouldn't need in the real world or which a compiler would pick up. For example, on one of the exams I declared a variable incorrectly, with the rest of my code is logically and syntax correct I only received 2/14 points. I approach external TA's who said I should receive points, but when I approached Fawzi on the regrade he refused to give points back and gave an excuse as to why. In additions we only had 2 exams unlike other classes, where they would split we had all of OO(Object oriented programming) and the entire second exam on every DS (data structure). \r\n\r\nOutside of the course work to sum up Fawzi in a few words:\r\n- shrewd/out right disrespectful \r\n    - Doesn't help in office hours. Always acts like he's better and we know nothing.\r\n- not lenient at all\r\n     - Was sick and couldn't make it for a quiz. Fawzi told me either to come for the quiz or receive a 0 (this was the second time I was sick and couldn't use a self attested note). Especially for a time while we are still in a pandemic this was out right disrespectful and foolish that he is willing to risk the health of his TA's and students for a quiz.  \r\n- doesn't care about his students mental or physical health\r\n   - Over this semester I was struggling with my mental health a bit and when I approached Fawzi about his essential response was I don't care. He is not as nice and caring as nelson, I didn't receive any help throughout the course during this. Outside of that office hours were always packed and the TA's were quite bad. \r\n- comes off as some high achieving professor with lots of publications and no time for his students when in reality he's a lecture (massive ego problem)\r\n\r\nOutside of this his class is taught like we are all high end comp sci people who know what we're doing. His exams once again are more difficult than nelsons. If you could I would avoid Fawzi at all cost and take Nelson. Nelson was one of the best professors I've had across all departments. \r\n\r\nOther Notes (sorry if repetitive to some other parts of the review):\r\n- Doesn't give practice exams\r\n- Doesn't tell us a concept list like Nelson or any other teachers\r\n- Refuses to record lecture \r\n- Steep late penalty (20% off your highest score if submitted at or after 11pm. 100% off after submitting 24hrs after the deadline).\r\n- 1 practice packet with questions that don't resemble exams a week\r\n- Quizzes were very hard for weekly assignments (we also didn't know the context)\r\n- Purposely goes into harder concepts which aren't relevant material to the course (refers to 351 and theoretical CS concepts we don't learn a lot). \r\n- Final Exam is the worst. 30% of the grade. Everything we wouldn't have been tested on for an FRQ was there. You cannot expect first time students with no experience to come in and redo parts of their project by hand. You cannot make students code out concepts you referred to for 5minutes in a lecture. You cannot make students code a question we have never seen a code example for and something which was barely touched in class. A final is cumulative that includes everything we were taught not everything after the midterms and the concepts we barely went over. \r\n- Labs also aren't too helpful and I think he should adjust the labs to have a due date of completion so students actually do then and cut down on the weight of the final exam. a final worth 30% dropped by grade from B to (well you can do the math for that :)). \r\n- Projects in others classes are worth way more overall than ours. \r\n\r\nFinal thoughts: I wish I took nelson when I had the opportunity to while registering. If I could go back into that time and choose nelson I would've probably got a B+ at the lowest. Nelson's exams side by side Fawzi's are much easier on relevant materials and won't make or break your grade such as Fawzi. Unlike the other reviews I can't say that he enjoys teaching.

I will however say that he uses his pencil and a paper to visualize what he is describing, and his handwriting is very ineligible and he has to erase so many times that I can't help but bother about the amount of eraser dust he produces.

I understood everything conceptually in lecture but when it came to quizzes and exams, I was absolutely 100% lost. It is hard to really know WHAT to study because nobody can tell you what topics are necessary to study for the exam. The exams test you on the most intricate tiniest details possible that you will NEVER EVER need to know in the real world. It is hard to remember every small detail. Such as knowing the asymptotic complexities for the insertion of a linkedList, knowing what URL stands for, etc... There are only two exams whereas other classes split into three exams. So both exams are extremely content heavy. I had Nelson for 131 and regret not taking him again for 132. Fawzi's lectures are extremely fast paced, he doesn't record lectures, nor does he allow electronic devices (laptops/tablets) out in class at all. Not to mention, you can never get any access to his previous exams so there is NO understanding of just how much we need to study or what needs to be studied. The study question sets that get posted on canvas have ZERO answer keys so there is absolutely no way in knowing if you are getting the correct answers or not. When asking Fawzi questions regarding what was said prior, he will redirect you to his TAs and tell you to go to office hours which makes the huge assumption that you even have time to attend office hours. I failed both midterm exams even after studying lecture notes, slideshows, in class examples, and the study questions. There is no curve. I currently have a 65% but am hoping that with passing the final with a 75%, I can get a C-. His expectations are way too high for a class such as this. This class has made me debate my whole career as a Computer Engineering major and this is just a 100 level course.\r\n\r\nWhat annoys me the most is that Fawzi is always making comments in class such as \"Guys I don't even look at my slides until right before class and I gotta quickly re-teach myself the material\"... He is always commenting on the fact that he writes Android programs etc... It is just an ick. Not to mention, when you express concerns about potentially failing his class he gives no strategies or help on how to pass the class. He just says study and see what happens. Well I studied my butt off and still failed the exams. \r\n\r\nFor projects, they will start out by being open projects and then after the first three, they are all closed projects.

He will never throw material that is overly complicated or has not been done on quizzes/labs/projects on the exam. I did not attend labs and barely studied and was able to complete quizzes with relative ease. If you do attend labs and study, you should expect at least a B in Fawzi's classes, with a very solid chance of an A. CMSC132 is a very fast-paced course, but he does not ask overly specific questions that would make you have to study for 5 hours. \r\n\r\nHe is very easy to understand and his teaching style is not bad. You can tell he is really determined to teach at his best every single lecture, and will even apologize if he feels he is not explaining it to the best of his ability. Goes over concepts, even if most people understand, multiple times to ensure that EVERYONE in the class understands, even if it is boring to the more advanced programmers. \r\n\r\nCons:\r\nAlthough some of his projects can be pretty straightforward, others can be very challenging. I do not suggest procrastinating on his projects, especially if he specifically mentions it is a harder project. Projects are worth roughly 3% of your grade so doing good on most, if not all of them, is very important. \r\n\r\nHe does not record lectures. He expects his students to attend all of his lectures, so it is important that you do so if you want to keep up. Missing one lecture could put you pretty far behind.

His midterms this semester were also extremely easy, but I think he was trying something new this semester with midterms, since they are generally known to be very difficult, but atleast for this semester the midterms were really easy and fair. In the beginning of the semester he mentioned that his final would be generally easier than his midterms which is why he weighs it 30% of the grade. However, the final was an absolute dumpster fire. Especially compared to the midterms, the final felt way too difficult. I also don't like how he has us do quizzes every week, and will tell TAs to not tell us what is on those quizzes, so there are many times I try and study for quizzes but what comes up on the quiz is not something that I studied, because I assumed the quiz would be about another topic. I also feel like his project descriptions in this class were not very good. They were extremely brief and many of the projects, except for a few exceptions, were really basic and uninteresting. I had him for 131 as well and I felt his projects in 131 were much better and creative. Him also not recording lecture and posting incomplete and not detailed slideshows really puts him down from other professors as I feel it is unfair that I have to struggle to catch up if I cannot make it to a single lecture due to sickness, or etc. Like there is no way for me to attend every single lecture 3 times a week for the entire semester. He also never gives us practice material with answer keys when it comes to these quizzes or tests and no previous exams to practice with. I would say there are definitely better options than him, like for 131 and 132, it would be better to go with nelson, elias, or pedram.

(Unless another section has Nelson, then it depends on your personality). \r\n\r\nPros: \r\n- The clearest, most focused and concise lecturer there is. Every lecture, he gives you exactly what you'll be expected to know: no confusion/ambiguity/wastes of time. You just have to be there, and you'll understand. I'm not lying: going to lecture felt like connecting a flash drive to my brain and downloading the entire course. He's just that good. \r\n- No recordings as is noted, but the slides are substantial enough that if you took notes in your lecture, you can find everything you need. \r\n- Extremely cracked at answering questions. Assuming you ask appropriate ones (no out of pocket ones), he'll be super clear and go in-depth. As a bonus, he'll often say \"I might ask you that on an exam\" when answering questions, then tell you the answer. I think at least 4 times in the semester, somebody's asked a question, Fawzi's said that, and then that question shows up on the exam (free points!). \r\n- Quizzes are veryyy predictable. I think I correctly predicted what would be on them for 8/10 quizzes we had. Essentially, he takes what you did the previous week, have a definition section, and a coding section which will be a slight variation of code done in lecture/lab. Essentially, if you study your definitions, do the labs, and remember the programming examples from lecture, you're guaranteed at least a 90 on all of them. \r\n- Exams are extremely fair. Exam 1: 85 median, Exam 2: 89 median, Final: 85 median. As mentioned before, he'll sometimes give you exam questions&solutions in lecture if you ask questions. Just like the quizzes, his exams are just definitions/applications of rules + coding problems. The coding problems are highkey easy: on every single exam, he stole a problem off of one of our labs, so if you study the labs, you'll be good. This really came to a head in the final: we had 3 programming questions, one was ripped straight off a lab, another straight off an example we did in class, and another straight off a project we did. Provided you study the code in the lecture examples, your labs, and your projects, you have nothing to worry abt :)\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Fawzi really does not exist outside lecture.

With Fawzi, although he does not record lectures, doesn't let you have electronics out, and has weekly quizzes that he doesn't tell you what is going to be on it (it's honestly very predictable what's going to be on the quizzes if you go to lecture and pay attention), he is honestly an outstanding lecturer. He explains everything so clearly yet quickly. Fawzi isn't a bad professor, his lecture examples are very helpful and the coding problems on his exams are almost from those examples and discussion lab work. If you come into lecture, pay attention, and try to at least take notes and have good study habits, you will be fine. It is okay to stress over this course because I struggled too, but he does not trick us on exams and quizzes, they are straightforward and he provides us so many resources for us to study from. TA's give us study questions and hold review sessions. The projects can be VERY annoying but if you start early and go to office hours you will be a-ok.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "", "created": "2024-02-22T20:06:38.224708Z"}, {"professor": "Fawzi Emad", "course": "CMSC132", "review": "Fawzi is an okay professor. Although he is a very good lecturer he barely provides any resources to study so it is quite hard to prepare for exams. 132 is quite easy if you understand data structures. Since this is a coding-heavy class it is really easy as you can just look at code examples from class and projects to study. I am currently taking 250 with Fawzi and it is not a good idea since 250 is a mostly math course and he provides little to no practice for exams.
