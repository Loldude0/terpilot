Class discussions were thought-provoking and interesting. The workload is very light: a one-page paper is due each week, and there is a final research paper (and 10 minute presentation) on a topic of your choosing that relates to science and religion. Professor Roy is a wonderful teacher who makes class enjoyable by inviting various guest speakers (such as Nobel Laureate Bill Phillips) to come and speak about their views on science and religion.

Workload for HONR269X consisted of some reading (technically not checked or graded, but very good to at least not look awkward during discussions), and one short paper a week.  The paper always asked for a brief summary of the last reading/presentation while incorporating your own thoughts on the matter.  Professor Roy brings many guest speakers in to talk.

Class structure in a typical week was discussing assigned readings one day and listening to guest lecturers on the other day.  It was beneficial to at least skim the readings for each class because a lot of the class was discussion, but reading the material is definitely manageable.  The final was a paper/presentation on a topic of your choice.

If you just show up to class and do the homework (without putting in much more work), you can easily expect a B in 272. With regard to exams - he has a unique and refreshing take on them. He cares much more that you understand stuff conceptually than he does your ability to plug stuff in or recite formulas. Because of that, all of his exams, quizzes, etc. were open note/textbook/internet. Professor Raj would pick one question from your homework set and offer it as an extra credit quiz every Friday.

Dr. Roy didn\u2019t do as much barebones teaching of the material, so there were definitely some gaps in learning. His TA was also pretty useless, so I actually ended up learning everything from the textbook, which Dr. Roy made sure was very accessible!

That's it! Every week the Honors group would meet together with Raj and our TA and we would simply share a small summary/report of our new findings that week. The schedule is very flexible and he canceled the meetings the week before a midterm so that we could study. It was a very fun experience where I learned a lot about what I like, and Raj was visibly very supportive of everyone, which was motivating. \r\n\r\nWhether you take Honors or not, Raj would be your best choice for any physics class.
