Here are my thoughts, coupled with theirs as well:\r\n(1) Sarna can be EITHER boring or engaging, depending on your attention span and willingness to focus. \r\n(2) He gives EVERYTHING needed for exams and your success (anyone who says otherwise just didn't use the resources presented to them).\r\n\r\nTo address (1), if you have a short attention span, you'll have to pull yourself up by your bootstraps. For me, I thoroughly enjoyed his lectures, and thought he was quite engaging. He has a slight (Indian) accent \u2013 which doesn't inhibit his ability to lecture!! \u2013 but his tone is soft and rather monotonous, so it is easy to lose focus espeeeeeciiially if you use a computer for notes. While I indeed liked his lectures, I also cannot count the amount of times I got sidetracked playing tetris. Side-note: he isn't monotone in a way that suggests he's not passionate about his course (the reality is the opposite), and he makes subtle jokes here and there.\r\n***My biggest suggestion is if you get distracted easily,*** take notes on a notebook and don't worry about making them look pretty. Sarna gives EVERYTHING you need on his powerpoints, which are all linked in Canvas; but he doesn't link the drawings and figures he puts alongside the powerpoints, which can be helpful for review (hence why notebooks are also good, since you can scribble the figures down). \r\n\r\nAs for (2), do not underestimate the class content. I took this class as a gen ed, and came in thinking I wouldn't have to ever review content. This was absolutely wrong, and I was surprised & disheartened at my first exam score. Understand the big-picture concepts, and memorize the equations. As with what the other reviews said, his exam review materials aren't great. His mock exams don't reflect the real exam at all, but I was lucky to have helpful TA's who made a mock exam that I believe will help me on the upcoming 2nd exam. Again, his EXAM REVIEW materials suck. NOT the powerpoints, which you can easily use as review material.\r\n\r\nTry to attend class IRL, and not over Zoom (which he gives an option for at the same hour). If you attend his lectures over Zoom, you can't ask questions since he mutes the students and doesn't look at the chat since he's in-tune with the IRL classroom.\r\n\r\nOverall, a good class. 7 homework assignments (the lowest 2 are dropped), 2 midterms, and a final.
