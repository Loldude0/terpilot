The workload is light and he is willing to work around YOUR schedule. Not many other professors are willing to make amends, especially if you missed a speech or need to move it to another day. He is one of the few professors that understands that we as students have our own struggles and schedules; his course bottoms out towards finals with practically no work. \r\n\r\nGeorge is a champ.

I'm usually annoyed by Gen-Ed type classes, but I think being able to speak in front of an audience is an extremely important skill, and throughout the semester I felt myself getting more confident for the speeches.

Super chill and laid-back guy, and he understands that students don't exactly prioritize his class over their other classes. In fact, he does not even want you to expend a large amount of time to his class compared to, for example, hard STEM classes. George was more of a friend than a lecturer to his students, and he holds a great presence. All weekly assignments take no more than half an hour total, and the speeches are not even that hard to prepare for. The midterm and final are also absolutely nothing to worry about, and I mean that literally because I don't think anyone will study for that for anything more than 10 minutes honestly. Classes are not mandatory, but you might miss a participation grade or two if you miss a day on a group activity day. I feel like I only went to like 50% of the Friday classes in all honesty.
