I took this class with his Spring '23, and on the syllabus, it says that he does not give A+, which was personally an immediate red flag. The grade is made up of 2 blog posts, 2 essays, and participation; however, he does none of the grading his graduate TA does. His TA was super nice, but he would take points off for small things and would never explain why he took points on that. Also, all of the essays and blog posts had really vague questions with no rubric, so you had absolutely no direction while writing. My biggest issue with the class was that there were no rubrics for the assignments and even after asking they provided no guidance, but overall the way the content was presented was great.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-05-14T18:25:39.686046Z"}, {"professor": "Christopher Bonner", "course": "HNUH218B", "review": "Great lecturer.
