Unfortunately, JWST141 is not an introductory level class and nor is it worth the effort. I attended close to every lecture, took thoughtful notes, and submitted assignments on time. In a separate course in the same semester, I earned A's and B's on papers. In Marsha's class, I was lucky to get a C, and with four assignment's throughout the semester, that does not leave much room for improvement. I took the class as an elective, hoping to expand my Jewish learning and to embrace Jewish history in America. Instead, I received my lowest grade in my undergraduate career.

This may be a bit of an adjustment to first-year students, but if one takes good notes and asks thoughtful questions in class, they will succeed. She is very knowledgeable about her field and presents the information in an organized way, usually giving an overview of every lecture's content before delving in. She assigns readings that more reinforce what she teaches, as the meat of the content is in her lectures. To succeed on exams, a lot of prep and memorization of details is necessary, but it's an easy A if the time is spent.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2021-09-12T14:31:12Z"}, {"professor": "Marsha Rozenblit", "course": "JWST345", "review": "I was worried about how much information this course was going to cover. Rozenblit started with a unit on the history of antisemitism that provided really important context for how the Holocaust came about. After the midterm, the information was not needed on the final, which was really nice. She doesn't assume you know any background of the Holocaust (so if you're coming in with nothing, you'll be fine), but she also keeps the information complex enough that if you've already been educated on the Holocaust, you won't feel like you're wasting your time. The class was a lot of work for exams, but her lectures were organized well and the readings were not too intense. She does assign these papers that take a lot of work, but if you ask her for help or guidance, she'll have your back.

I feel like the information is very valuable and interesting. Each class is a lecture, so be prepared to sit for a long time. My friend and I always take bathroom breaks halfway through LOL. Rozenblit is a very good professor. I know she doesn't have great reviews, but I loved learning from her. Highly recommend talking to her after class and getting to know her a little so she has motivation to give you a good grade in class. The grade consists of a midterm (25%), 5-page paper (25%),Response paper (15%), final (30%), and class participation (5%). I will say that she is on the harsher side of a grader, but I really didn't mind. In short, if you don't mind putting in a little more work than anticipated for a 100-level class, I would highly recommend this course if the subject matter is interesting to you.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "B+", "created": "2023-12-01T16:25:58.040796Z"}, {"professor": "Marsha Rozenblit", "course": "JWST141", "review": "Do not take this class if you want an easy A.
