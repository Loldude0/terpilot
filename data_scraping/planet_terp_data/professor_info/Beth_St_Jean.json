I wish she could teach all my classes at UMD. She wants you to call her by her first name and uses PowerPoint that are all posted at the start of the semester so you can find everything easily. There is one big group project with multiple due dates for different parts two individual essays and two quizzes that are open notes. If you put a little effort into everything it is impossible not to pass but try because it's all super easy to understand and Beth is the best Professor and makes it fun. She's chill about attendance but does take it. If you don't go or email her before she's super flexible and cares so much for your well-being. Get to know her also, she's super personable and so fun to talk to after class when I had some time to kill before my next class because she always ended 15-30 min earlier. The only thing I would say is my class was a 9:30 am so if she didn't use all the time, I would have preferred a later start time at 10 am.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2024-01-16T04:25:09.501301Z"}, {"professor": "Beth St Jean", "course": "INST232C", "review": "so so SO sweet and genuinely is very passionate about what she's teaching.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "", "created": "2024-01-19T00:53:00.413999Z"}], "name": "Beth St Jean", "slug": "st_jean"}
