His exams are fairly easy. He has a review session prior to the midterm and final. Has no quizzes if everyone participates in discussion.

This class is easy if you read and pay attention. Jason is very easy to get a long with and if you ever have a problem within the course or with his teaching style he makes it clear that you can talk to him.
