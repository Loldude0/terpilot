But, I am so glad that I took her! She is such a fun and crazy (in the best way possible) teacher, and she made chemistry so interesting. \n\r\nDon't be fooled though. This class isn't a walk in the park. She does go through the material at a fast pace, but just ask questions in class if you are confused and she will stop and answer them! I took AP Chem in high school, and I guess that helped, but Dr. Dixon was such a good and clear teacher that I think I would have been fine if I hadn't taken AP Chem before coming in. \n\r\nALWAYS TAKE THE EXTRA CREDIT OPPORTUNITIES!!! She gives a good amount of extra credit (about 30-40 points), but you do have to work for it. She also doesn't do a plus minus system, which is really awesome. If you are borderline and you do all the online assignments, there's a chance you will be bumped up to the next letter grade! so take advantage of that!\n\r\nCLICKER QUESTIONS! She has 40 clicker questions. I don't know if she always does this, but for us, I feel like there were more clicker questions in the beginning of the year than at the end. So in the beginning half of the year, I would recommend just always being ready for her to spring a clicker question or two on you. She doesn't give you a lot of time to answer it. If you don't know what you're doing, you're kinda screwed. I was lucky enough to surround myself with a group of friends and we worked through each one together (which she is fine with). She also does like 5-7 clicker questions before each exam to give you some practice. Those helped a lot and gave me some idea of what topics would be on the exam/what kind of questions to expect. Some clicker questions are meant to trick you. But she goes over them if most of the class doesn't get it right. And hey! Better to get tricked on a 1 point clicker question than to get tricked on a 8 point question on the test!\n\r\nBefore each exam and the final, she tells you exactly what she is going to test you on. \n\r\nPersonally, I never had a problem with timing on an exam. But that might be because I just write really fast.i dunno. But I always finished with about 20 minutes to spare, which gave me time to check through my work at least 3 times (and usually I made a lot of little stupid mistakes so those 20 minutes gave me time to redo some problems) \n\r\nMake SURE you study for the extra credit pre-test because it is an awesome grade booster. \n\r\nThis may not be the case every year, but for me, I thought the first two exams were significantly easier than the third one. BUT! The third exam is still do-able. I studied probably around 3-4 hours for each exam. I just looked through my notes, clicker questions, and old exams (she has a bunch in her office). \n\r\nHer homework is not that bad. I got an A on every single one, but that required a couple hours of work. The homework questions aren't impossible, but I think everyone just wanted to make sure they got that 10/10. \n\r\nShe has AMAZING office hours. There are always a bunch of students in her office, either asking her questions, or sitting around working on homework or studying for an exam. \n\r\nI didn't really go to GSS The girls who taught GSS for us were super nice and helpful. I didn't go often because I like to study at my own pace. But if you are a person who likes to have someone teaching you stuff and working through problems with you, then definitely go! \n\r\nOVERALL...TAKE THE CLASS!

She's a fantastic and fun person (she plays music at the start of class), she knows exactly what she's talking about all the time, she's really helpful and caring, honesty perfect. Probably one of the things I'm the most grateful for is that she tailors her course material directly to what she tests you on. If you do the work, and you study what she says, you won't see anything on the exam that you weren't expecting. She lets you know exactly what she wants, exactly the format to put it in, and exactly what you need to do. The way she grades is also great, a lot of teachers will take off  for small arithmetic mistakes and annoying things like that. Dr. Dixon will grade you for getting each step of the problem right, so if you set it up you get some points, if you move on to the next step you get some points, and the final answer is only worth some of the credit, it's great and it makes the class feel really fair. She had fantastic TAs and she communicated with them really well, they were all willing to adjust their schedules and help us out as best they could and even do some extra GSS's. I have no idea how Dr. Dixon manages her time with the amount of stuff she does for us. One time this semester her TA had a medical emergency so she ran almost all the discussion sessions herself, I can imagine any other teacher just canceling them and apologizing but not Dr. D.\n\r\nAfter all those compliments, legitimately the ONLY downside to this course is that it is extremely difficult. The tests are hard, the homework is hard, even lecture is pretty rigorous (I missed a single lecture and I felt way behind). I devoted the majority of my time and emotional effort this semester to this class in order to keep up. Also, time is a huge issue on exams, she makes them so you can just barely finish in the time given.\n\r\nThe thing about Dixon is that she makes you really want to do well in her class. This is the first serious chemistry class I've ever taken and it's made me love chemistry. It's so interesting and the way Dr. Dixon talks about it makes me like it even more. I know I already said this but I just want to emphasize that she is such a fun person, Chemistry is probably one of the only classes I have this year that I actually really enjoy going to.\n\r\nI think I'm going to get an A or a B. After every test Dr. Dixon will check in with how many points you should have to be on track for an A, B, C, etc. Also, word of advice, use the chat page on elms before an exam.

Dr. Dixon is the hardest, but hands-down, the best chemistry professor on campus. If you take Dixon, you will know your shit, but she will force you to LEARN that shit in order to even do DECENTLY in her class. I have never worked as hard in a class as I did in this one, and at the end of the semester, Dixon recognized that and bumped me up from a B+ to an A (she doesn\u2019t do minuses). But let me tell you, I worked for it. I went to GSS consistently, did the weekly quizzes, used Klein\u2019s Orgo as a Second Language book, was in her office hours regularly, went to all the discussions, and studied with friends for homework and before exams. Her class taught me to work my ass off for what I want, and that\u2019s going to be a lesson that I use many more times in life. Orgo with Dixon is A LOT OF WORK though. I took it at the same time as genetics and with 17 credits and barely made it out alive (genetics took most of the hits in terms of grades though, all my other classes turned out fine.) It was definitely my hardest class but the most rewarding. It takes up a lot of time so be careful what classes you take along with it. Dixon is honestly such a nice, funny, and amazing person and professor, but she\u2019s strict and will tell you how it is bluntly, so don\u2019t expect any sympathy. But she really does care about her students- she\u2019s not out to get you- she throws curveballs on tests but her logic is that she warns us about those curveballs ahead of time (truth.) She will present the information in class to you on a surface level basis and will expect you to enhance your understanding through the homework and weekly quizzes. I prefer having people explain things to me, so I took the initiative to enhance my own understanding by doing the crap ton of stuff I did outside of class listed above. If you\u2019re looking for the easy A for orgo, don\u2019t take Dixon.

That being said there is obviously a curve which only really depends on your classmates.  She has no set numbers and you are truly at the mercy of how well your classmates are doing in the class.

Never have I met someone who does more to help her students succeed. I'm fairly certain she literally lives in her office waiting for students to come by and get help on the email problems or on old test questions that they don't understand, and what she said at the beginning of the semester is true: organic chemistry is like a part-time job.\n\r\nShe doesn't really go by the textbook at all - it was useful to go over nomenclature and basic information for the first quiz, but after that, I barely used it at all. If you go to her weekly reviews, go to her office hours, and do the weekly \"quizzes\" that she emails out, you will be as prepared as you possibly can be for her exams. She focuses on helping you actually UNDERSTAND the way reactions work, not just memorize them. So yes, her exams are tough and yes, the averages are dismally low (usually around 50 percent), but hey, that means that if you can manage to get half the questions right on a test, you got a B! I had a solid B average all semester (I scored right around the average on both quizzes and one exam, and did significantly better than the average on one exam), and as she promised, I got an A on the final and an A in the class. But it's not a 90% A - it's an A, as in one standard deviation above the average.\n\r\nPeople will tell you that she is difficult and that her class is work, and both are true, but if you want a solid foundation in organic chemistry, and a professor who is so willing to help you with anything and everything you want to ask her about, then Dr. Dixon is definitely the right choice.

This is a research university. Most professors here only really care about their research and the whole teaching thing is kinda just part of the deal between them and the school.

I need to be able to read something several times over so I can process that.  However, Dixon is really geared towards auditory learners.  You HAVE to listen during lecture to get the class.  She has also worked very hard to develop a curriculum that she feels is best, which means she doesn't really stick to the order of conventional textbooks.  She's really a great teacher, I won't deny that, but if you are someone who likes to take the time to sit down and process things on your own, you're going to be out of luck here because she doesn't provide many resources for learning the concepts outside of the class.  She certainly provides a lot of practice work to hone your skills, but if you didn't pick up the methodology or conceptual bit in class, you're out of luck.\n\r\nThe textbook we're asked to buy makes a great doorstop.  She told my class that she basically doesn't use it, except for a list of practice problems from the book she gives out.  However, those problems aren't generally in the style she uses in her own problems and on tests, so they aren't much good.  Ask yourself if you want to pay $100+ for some okay practice problems.  You're better off buying Organic Chemistry as a Second Language, which is how I learned most of the concepts.  I would recommend getting a jump on everyone else and just make a habit of going to her office hours from the beginning.

First off, organic chemistry is going to be hard no matter who you take it with. The reason I learned so well from Dr. Dixon is because her format of teaching was a very logical approach rather than fooling around with molecule model sets and picturing stuff in thin air. I appreciated her step by step, fool proof methods of tackling these problems. On a side note, if you are more of a visual learner then maybe a teacher who uses molecule model sets would be best for you. If you like the step by step, logical approach then she's your best bet. I will admit, she is very tough but if you want to take the MCAT or if you know you will be moving on to ORGO 2 then I think you will be most prepared if you take Dixon. If you're pre-med then I definitely recommend her. If you're just looking for the easiest way out of this course then I would question your motivation toward being pre-med to begin with. Dr. Dixon is such a good teacher that not only did I get an B in her class, but I never once opened my text book. She gives TONS, and I mean, TONS of study guides, outside help, answer keys to practice quizzes. I never once needed the text book. I would have had an A if I hadn't bombed the final. With that being said I feel that the final was very fairly written, I was just retarded from lack of sleep. And I'm not one of those freakishly wierd genius kids either. As a matter of fact, I failed G chem! \r\nMy advice if you take her:\r\n1. GO TO LECTURE. If you miss lecture, consider yourself done. You cannot expect anything better than a C if you don't go to lecture. Her exams are ripped straight out of lecture.\r\n2. Do all of her practice quizzes and study guides that she emails to you. They help so much, especially if you try to work through them yourself before you peek at the answer key.\r\n3. GO to office hours! The woman practically lives in her office to help you, you should take advantage! If you have any doubt or question on one of those practice quizzes then go straight to her.

You can see this if you go to her office hours (on zoom or in her office) or if you ask her questions after lecture. I will agree with some reviews below that Dr. Dixon has some sort of obsession with NMR spectroscopy, but I found it more rewarding when I could use NMR spectroscopy analysis as a part of synthesizing a molecule.\r\n\r\nExams: They are difficult but extremely fair.

Other than that, her notes are organized and she has a lot of resources/videos to help people online. I never personally have tried to go to office hours, but I'm told it's pretty difficult to talk to her due to the amount of people there. Weekly homeworks aren't too bad if you understand what's going on in class and if you don't, you can figure out how to do them based on the notes she posts. In terms of the exams, there's an almost excessive amount of extra credit both before the exam and built into the actual exam and exams are pretty directly based on the HW, so if you understand how to do the reactions and what's actually going on chemically in the reactions, it isn't super difficult to get good grades. That being said, our class averages for exams are not great (usually in the 60s), as expected from any UMD chem class, which means there's a curve at the end as well. Honestly, I didn't really learn very much synthesis in Orgo I because my professor spent like 2 days on them so it was a little difficult for me to catch up at the beginning of Orgo II and Dixon does expect you to come in knowing quite a bit of synthesis, but with a little hard work, this class is not too bad. There's a lot of practice opportunities and Dixon herself seems sweet and wants to help students as much as possible.

I honestly LOVE her, I know some reviews may be mixed (I also haven't had her for biochem, so I can't speak on her teaching for that specific course). No doubt this class is going to be hard, especially if you don't have a solid Orgo I background, but as long as you put in the time and effort, you can definitely pull off getting a good grade in this class - coming from someone who got a B in Orgo I and is on track to getting an A in Orgo II. \r\nWe have a problem set (pretty hard, questions are typically harder than what you see on the exam and they're graded for accuracy), and I HIGHLY recommend going to office hours or asking your discussion TA for feedback before submitting. I wasn't able to make office hours for one or two homework assignments, and my grade for those problem sets definitely reflected that. \r\nDr. Dixon's office hours are typically very busy, but even if you don't get a chance to talk to her while attending, it's always a good place to collaborate with classmates and try and hear the advice she's giving to other students because most of the time I've found people have the same questions I do! \r\nI also highly recommend going to EVERY CAN session she holds, for my class, she held CAN every Monday night from 9-10 pm and went over relevant problems and answered any needed questions. Before exams, she would typically go over an old exam and allow 10-15 minutes at the end to answer any questions. Even if you don't have any particular questions about the topics she's going over, it's always good to attend and see her solve a few problems especially since she goes pretty fast during lectures (and class lectures aren't recorded). \r\nThe 3 exams we had this semester were very fair, the averages typically fell around the high 50s-low 60s and went up a bit throughout the semester given that some people dropped the class. Dixon typically gives a 10-12 pt extra credit assignment due the Sunday before the exam, these problem sets are also pretty hard, but if you work with other students, you can get all if not a decent amount of the offered extra credit! Dixon's exams are pretty long, but even if you don't finish an exam she typically writes her exam to be out of 120 points (even though the max is 100) to allow you to go through and solve the problems you're more confident on. \r\nI've seen other reviewers complain about Dixon moving too fast or talking a lot about herself, which is true in part, but she always posts her whiteboard after class (so if you missed copying down something you can refer to it after class) and I find her little \"side stories\" always help give me a break from the overloading content because being so real Orgo II is ALOT and it's nice to take a break from hard material sometimes and talk about something a bit more light-hearted (I also had 75min lectures at 8 am which was pretty rough).\r\nYou can't go wrong with taking Dixon for Chem241, and I highly recommend especially if you want a good background going into Biochem!", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A-", "created": "2023-12-09T21:49:33.230318Z"}, {"professor": "Bonnie Dixon", "course": "BCHM463", "review": "Its a hard class and Dixon can be a bit disorganized which can be rough given the pace this class goes at in order to fit in all the content.

The homeworks are designed to be harder than the tests or at least, same level. You cannot get a good grade completing the homeworks on your own time, she makes it so you have to go to her office hours. Her office hours are almost every day from 2-5 hours, but remember that she is probably teaching 2 other classes than yours so those students are also attending. You're competing anywhere from 5-20 students for her attention to help you. \r\nAlso, I wasn't a fan of the way she lectured. Felt kinda all over the place and she goes FAST. and i mean FAST. No textbook either. My advice if you take her? Record her lectures, make a study group FAST for those homeworks and tests, and either make a time to go to office hours or be friends with people who do go.

My only issue with her is her being kinda intimidating and not super open to questions.
