I showed up every class with the printed powerpoints (as instructed by him) and found myself hardly ever annotating them because he hardly elaborated on his slides, he just reads straight off of them. The homework is only 15 mins worth of reading for discussion every week (Heath was my TA and he did an excellent job elaborating on the concepts). Honestly though if it wasn't for Econ200 I would have done worse, which is why I only recommend this GenEd if 200 is taken alongside it.", "rating": 2, "expected_grade": "B-", "created": "2017-12-22T01:57:50Z"}, {"professor": "Peter Murrell", "course": "ECON111", "review": "Easy class to get a B in, slightly hard to an A. There are 5 grades. 1st grade: participation quizzes. Once a week in discussion there is an easy quiz based on the assigned readings for the week. Make sure you do the readings. The reading usually took me around half an hour per week. My TA was Heath and he was great and messaged us once a week on what readings to do. 2nd grade: presentation. You make a short presentation with a partner in discussion and present it in discussion. I\u2019m awful at public speaking and blanked at one point and somehow still got a B on it. So dw too much. 3rd grade: midterm. The best way to study for his exams is to do all the practice problems he has available in files on elms. Going over slides can help too but it\u2019s mostly the practice problems. He provides solutions. 4th grade: paper. This is a bit difficult and took me some time but there\u2019s only 1 per semester and it\u2019s due at the end of the semester. Make sure you pick a good article and make a plan. 5th grade: Final. Do the same thing as the midterm. I only studied for each Econ exam for 2-3 hours where I just did his practice problems and got an above average grade each time. And I went to 2 lectures total! His lectures are useless and there\u2019s no point in going.
