Her passion for teaching and her love for her students are clearly demonstrated through her continued preparation for class, challenging but reasonable workload, among many other things. If you're new to programming, this is the professor you'll want to have. She will get you interested in computer science and keep you excited to show up to class.

She's very lenient with grading, and especially in this course you're not expected to have any background knowledge. Pacing is perfect and she's very receptive to questions, she responds to emails relatively quickly, and she really just wants to see everyone succeed. Very lenient with deadlines, I turned in some major assignments due in November by the end of the semester and she still graded it with only a 10% deduction. I had prior programming knowledge, but my friends in this class were completely new to it and still succeeded. If you have the chance to take this professor, no matter the class, take her.

She really does want to see the students succeed in her class and provides a 48-hour grace period or more if you email her. She explains as much as possible, especially when a student does not understand. The course itself could be challenging, especially if you do not have experience, but it is not impossible. Attend office hours/TA hours if you need extra help because they definitely help. Her assignments typically consist of small projects, knowledge checks, and one final project (you begin working on it early in the semester). I had no knowledge of comp. science at all before this class, but if you put in the effort you can get a good grade. Overall a great/fun class with a very chill professor.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-02-01T16:49:32.045796Z"}, {"professor": "Jennifer Manly", "course": "CMSC122", "review": "Professor Manly is such a nice teacher and is always willing to help.

While I went into the class with some experience, it was clear she put in effort to help beginners learn just as efficiently as more experienced programmers. She is extremely nice and lenient, basically every assignment has a 2 day grace period where you can turn it in late with no penalty, she will grant you an extension without any reason, just send her an email.
