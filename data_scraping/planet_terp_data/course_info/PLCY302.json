She is also very lenient with her grading and her classes. Attendance is not mandatory, but very strongly required. My only problem with this class is that she never posted rubrics, so if you did not go to class the day before a paper was due, you had no idea of the formatting and things she would look for on it. It was not that bad because she is an easy grader, but at the same time, it sucks because you got lots of points off because of something you had no idea you had to do. Other than wishing she gave more specific instructions, she is a great professor and a very nice person. The class is very easy, other than a discussion post a week, and three papers throughout the semester, there isnt much you have to do for it.
