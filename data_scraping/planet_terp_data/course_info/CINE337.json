Professor Kuo does not do any actual teaching, there is no lecture. We watch a movie in every class and have a 5-minute discussion afterward.

Students will consider a wide range of art forms (painting, photography, video, installation, web-based media, and film) in four broad themes (uses of the past; critiques of power; representations of race, gender, and sexuality; socially engaged art) and explore the complex intertwining of the political, historical, and aesthetic aspects in Chinese contemporary art and film, as well as the multiple contexts in which these artworks are created and circulated.", "is_recent": true, "geneds": null}
