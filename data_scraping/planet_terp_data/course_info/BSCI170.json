Dr. Haag does not give any extra credit, and the course is primarily based on 3 exams (lowest gets dropped) and a final.

There is no review before exams and no resources to help you study other than reviewing her powerpoints which are super long and complicated. She moves incredibly fast through topics and gives the bare minimum explanation. She expects you to come in already knowing the material. If you can, choose any other professor for this class.
