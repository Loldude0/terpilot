He asks questions to the class and if you have a questions he will really try to get you an answer, he wants you to succeed and learn. If you are an engineering major you may struggle a bit. His lectures will bog you down with fine details and things that you may not have to care about or may not apply to you. His lectures are also almost entirely conceptual which can be hard for engineers who are used to building things and using numbers physical literal examples. His grading scale is very generous, the homeworks are textbook problems that you have 2 weeks to do and while his exams are hard, he will only count your higher midterms and if you do better than either midterm on the final he will use your final exam grade as 80% of your total grade. This class isn't a lot of work and honestly if you show up and take notes and pay attention you will be fine.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "B+", "created": "2023-11-16T02:05:17.705293Z"}, {"professor": "Drew Baden", "course": "PHYS270", "review": "Baden made phys270 a great and enjoyable class to be in, the concepts were never too hard and the exams were very easy but he made sure that we knew the underlying concepts with more depth than was required for the class so we could actually learn them. As a physicist, he emphasized learning these concepts not just to apply them but also to influence how we think (he himself admitted that relativity and quantum mechanics was not something most of us would use anyway, but that it was still important to learn them). His lectures are engaging and interesting, and he could always answer student questions immediately and with great clarity that brought insight to the topics. The only complaint I ever had from his class was that he would consistently go 2-3 minutes over time at the end of class to finish explaining his topic, which is certainly a lot less of a complaint than most professors at UMD. It goes to show how good Baden is that lectures always had very good attendance even though he never really made lecture attendance graded.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-11-29T13:44:04.129444Z"}, {"professor": "Drew Baden", "course": "PHYS270", "review": "Excellent lecturer, and a really nice guy.
