She is clearly knowledgeable about the subject, both confident and passionate to speak on the variety of topics that the course covers. While the class does assign a lot of work, it is by no means unmanageable. Pretty sure the class needs to assign this much work to be deserving of 3 credits and fulfilling both IS and SP geneds, certainly not the fault of Roan. She even encouraged us to skim the readings to get the main point rather than read their entirety. She always tries to engage with students, and has engaging lectures that are even fun at times. She is fair with grading, always gives feedback, and reads our journal entries in full to give personal responses to what we have to say.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-11-29T13:39:44.920793Z"}, {"professor": "Roan Parrish", "course": "ENES240", "review": "Fair with gradings, gives ~30 min of homework a week.

I dropped another I-Series class just to take this one and I do not think I made the right choice. There are just so many little tedious assignments that you have to do and it gets a bit frustrating. But I will say Roan is a nice professor and really does give good feedback. In the beginning, I feel as if she was pretty lenient with grades but as the class progressed she got a bit stricter.
