I learned almost nothing from this class, because, duh, he doesn't teach at all. Most of the class time is spent either meeting with your teams for the class project (will get to it in a sec). And even when he lectures, the topics are lamest and most useless. \"Change is inevitable,\" he will say multiple times during the lectures. And that's about all you will get from this class (but didn't you already know that).\r\nNow about the class project. One of the most horribly designed software I have ever seen in my life -- Terpnav. The thing (hard to call it a software) has 10 different languages supporting it, is spread over multiple machines with source code that has no documentation, and even Purtilo doesn't know how to install and run the thing. But he persists with it every semester, makes students add features to it, which is not hard in itself, but dealing with this beast of a software is the most annoying part, and yet not worth it at all. And the final is a take-home, which is entirely based on the TerpNav project. So, almost all your grade comes from the class project. He will say in the beginning there will be smaller projects too (we had just one), but essentially what you do with TerpNav is all that accounts for your grade.\r\nTake this class with anyone but Purtilo.

I greatly enjoyed this class, but at times I felt that Memon could be more straightforward and helpful by providing more information about certain topics. He would usually answer any student questions by addressing the entire class and relying on other members of the class, but this may be because he is promoting a do-it-yourself attitude for software engineering.

Purtilo seemed like a nice guy. Little did I know the absolute piece of human debris this so-called man actually embodied. I took this class in my final semester. On the first quiz, the SYLLABUS quiz, he falsely accused me of cheating. Rather than talking to me about it, he went straight to the University. This could have completely derailed my reputation and ability to graduate on time. I was found innocent because thankfully the other accused party admitted to cheating off of ME on the quiz. From that point on, it seemed this \"teacher\" had it out for me. His teaching style is horrific. He is, as the kids say, a donkey-hole. He did not teach a single substantive thing the entire year besides common sense work habits and practices. No technical skills taught whatsoever. He makes everyone keep GRADED journal entries of their class-related activities, but only accepts the journal entries to be given on his own personal webpage (which half the class did not know existed) (he refused to accept my handwritten journal entries). His grading system for quizzes and projects is completely abstract and holds zero standards. For the final project, which is worth about half your grade, he divided us up into teams, gave each team a different project description, and continued to change the project requirements and give unclear answers of his expectations. He would then blame us (my teammates and I) for the confusion that he orchestrated. I pulled two all-nighters in all of college, both for this final project. My teammates and I worked our donkeys off, and we stayed up until the last waking minute to get everything done correctly. At 11pm the night it is due, he set out an email with a new requirement to all of our surprise: a five page report..... added on to the final project. We submitted the project well into the night, and by 9am, after literlly spending all semester and multiple crazy late nights on this, he had it graded. By 9am. Literally hours after submitted. A large scale coding project, a 20 page paper, and a 5 page report. And he gave us all the same grade (even though he said he would grade on team participation as well). He gave us all an F. BY THE WAY, each team final project was just a personal pet project that he wanted to personally use, and each team's project was entirely different from every other team, which is completely unfair in terms of expectation and grade. He clearly has class favorites (if you are a kiss-donkey and teacher's pet, you get an A, otherwise, you get a C). He pretends to care about your issues in class then in private he scolds you for being \"stupid\" and \"dishonest\". He said in the beginning of the final project that JIRA is encouraged to be used, only to completely disregard all out JIRA entries once submitted and treated it as if we did zero task tracking because \"its on JIRA, that's not the right format\". His class is endless and thankless work, zero gain, useless busy work, and a compete mess.

After all, what better way is there to learn software engineering than engineering software? If you are open to this kind of course experience, and you\u2019re engaged and you take the project seriously, I promise you will get the intended value (of which there is a lot to gain) from this course, and you will do well. \r\n\r\n\u2028\u2028This class is about more than just writing software. Some people do not like or appreciate this aspect of the course. Each project is real, so you\u2019ll be solving an actual problem for some stakeholder.

You'll spend much of the course working on a semester long group project. You'll get real experience working with actual stakeholders who have an actual need for the project you're working on. You'll learn to (and actually get to) look at a project holistically, from proposing a solution, to building and testing that solution, to actually delivering that solution to the stakeholder. You'll deal with real challenges, setbacks, and learning opportunities just as you would in a real engineering position, except you're doing it in a classroom environment where you can receive mentoring and real time feedback. The amount you get out of this course (and your grade at the end) is directly proportional to the amount of effort you put into the class. \r\n\r\nThe professor takes care to carefully pair people together who have similar work ethics and habits. This generally does mean that the people who take the most leadership, initiative, and care most about the quality of their work are placed into the same group, and those who show less diligence are placed into other groups. You'll go through a series of exercises at the start of the semester to gauge work ethic. Your group does determine a lot about how successful you are in this class, but everything is deliberate. If you come in the first day ready to learn, put full effort into everything and care about the quality of the work you're doing, you'll be put in a group with likeminded individuals and you'll have no issue meeting course expectations. If you don't show as much initiative or struggle to meet expectations, you'll be put into a group with similar people and will likely not have as great a time. Purtilo is also a great resource. He's very honest with your work and is willing to give you feedback. He's super responsive on email and is always willing to help.
