She's a great teacher and makes the class interesting. Warning: this class does require a lot of reading (which many people avoided and just read summaries) but it is worth it. I would say that this class best helped me to be prepared to teach English lit by allowing us to be exposed to a lot of teaching material and content. The class was mostly group work in which we would talk about our book and then rotate. Through this method, Every student was able to gain insight into 3-4x as many books. \r\n\r\nDef recommend taking this class as there were not a lot of assignments and your peers are bound to become new friends. \r\n", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2022-08-04T19:35:14Z"}, {"professor": "Rasha Alkhateeb", "course": "TLPL457", "review": "rasha is the sweetest pea and deserves the world. cares a lot about her students and it shows. love her, couldn't recommend her enough <333", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2024-02-08T21:24:13.077826Z"}], "department": "TLPL", "course_number": "457", "name": "TLPL457", "title": "Literature for Adolescents", "credits": 3, "description": "<b>Restriction:</b> Minimum cumulative GPA of 2.75; and permission of EDUC-Teaching and Learning, Policy and Leadership department.\n<b>Credit only granted for:</b> EDCI466 or TLPL457.\n<b>Formerly:</b> EDCI466.\nReading and analysis of fiction and nonfiction; methods for critically assessing quality and appeal; current theory and methods of instruction; research on response to literature; curriculum design and selection of books.", "is_recent": true, "geneds": null}
