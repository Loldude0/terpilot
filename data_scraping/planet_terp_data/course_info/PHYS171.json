However, when it comes to teaching, Dr. Seo's teaching can get very confusing as she overcomplicates topics and when she writes on the board, it is an incomprehensible mess. Her accent is not hard to understand at all, and she is loud enough in my opinion. On exams, there are some major points of disconnect between what her/the TA write and the assumptions we believe we can make based on how the exams written. The homework assignments are also decently hard. Overall, if you have a good group to study with, attend discussions, and ask questions, your grade will be fine. But having a good study group is CRUCIAL. I also think she is harsh and blunt with how she talks to people at times, like if you ask a question she thinks you should already know or if you give a completely wrong answer, she will let it be known and make you feel dumb for it--which I really did not like.

So even though class average on the 3rd exam was a 57, the other two had averages in the 80s and since I took 2 years of physics in high school, the topics were familiar and easy to navigate. \r\n\r\nHer attitude after the 3rd exam was also a little off: She suggested that we just had been slacking off which was why the average was low. No we weren't, it's just a much harder topic and her lectures were never good but when its an unfamiliar topic and awful (even worse than before because it's more nuanced) lectures about it, that is going to reflect in the grades. \r\n\r\nThere were a few instances where she got irritated at people asking questions which confused her and she started yelling about how they don't know what they're talking about. \r\n\r\nThe TA was wonderful and her discussion and office hours is helpful. \r\n\r\nI also recommend taking PHYS172 with it (1 credit pass fail course which is just an extra 171 lecture), the professor Shawhan is a great additional once/week lecture and was in my opinion much more helpful than Dr. Seo. \r\n\r\nShe's such a sweet, funny lady so it pains me to say this, but I hope she can improve her lectures in the future.", "rating": 2, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-05-05T00:58:54.472703Z"}, {"professor": "Eun-Suk Seo", "course": "PHYS171", "review": "Dr Seo is living proof that being a good person and a good researcher does not under any circumstances make you a good professor.

The textbook that he recommends and uses for this course isn't the best at explaining concepts and can leave you confused. I ended up having to rely on alternate textbooks. He assigns a ton of homework - both online (on Pearson IIRC) and questions from the textbook.
