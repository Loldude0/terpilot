You have two projects, one is a group project about an assigned crop and the other is a 5-7 page paragraph about any crop scientist of your choosing. As long as you hit all the instructions for those projects you will get an A. I stopped showing up to class after the third week and finished the course with a 99%. My advice though is to not take 113 and to take another lab.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-12-22T23:18:00.228771Z"}, {"professor": "Kayla Griffith", "course": "PLSC112", "review": "Professor Griffith is not a bad professor by any means but also not the best. Pretty average lecturer (read of the slides most of the time). She used to respond to emails which was helpful and also was willing to answer questions after class if you had any. Her grading wasn't harsh on writing assignments. Sometimes things did get a little unorganized but in general the class was not too bad.
