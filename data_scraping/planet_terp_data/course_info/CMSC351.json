You are technically not allowed to work together on homeworks but I'm guessing the good reviewers who studied in groups did anyway.\n\r\nYou basically have to study in groups or be very good at algorithm theory in order to get a good grade", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "", "created": "2010-07-03T04:50:00Z"}, {"professor": "Evan Golub", "course": "CMSC351", "review": "I don't know what the deal is with what ALMOST EVERYONE told me but this class has been fairly easy. One thing to note about this class (which is perhaps why I found it easy) is that the material that you learn is actually extremely relevant to the field of computer science. If you tackle the material with that attitude you're bound to do much better in the class. I have had internship interview questions based on material learned in the class -- so learn the material any way that you can!\n\r\nThe only thing about Golub's class is that you need to be in lecture. You need to learn how he wants all of the problems' solutions to be set up -- exactly the way he does them in class. Do your best on homework and try to imitate his examples in lecture to get the best grade. Also, definitely do the thought questions -- get a study group. I can't stress this tip enough. His exams seemed to be based much more on the thought questions than the homework questions (how convenient..) -- and if you've done the thought questions, you're bound to ace the exam.\n\r\nGo to office hours if you are confused about something. He actually is very helpful in office hours (not necessarily in class), just make sure that you have notes from class because the first thing some of the TA's and Golub sometimes asks is \"okay, well lets look at your notes.\"\n\r\nIf you do miss a class make sure to get the notes from someone else. If you miss some classes you can still get away with an awesome grade, but if you miss even a single one of the classes where he discusses critical material, you're grade will drop like a rock unless you have access to someone else's notes.\n\r\nAll three of our midterms were pick 4 out of 5 questions. It was not this way in the past semesters (not for all 3 exams anyway) so don't bank on it, but it did make the class a hell of a lot easier. He also tells you he weighs grading as follows: 17% per exam, 14% homeworks+quizzes+projects, 35% final. For us, he changed it to 12% lowest midterm, 17% middle midterm, 22% best midterm, and for the homework section (which totalled 150 pts), he took the score out of 125 instead. \n\r\nHe also seems to curve exams arbitrarily..but everyone else has already touched on how he curves. Our first exam was taken out of 88 points, our second was 95, and third 97 or so. I would have expected a much higher curve for the second exam, which makes me wonder where he gets his numbers from (the 12 point curve on the first exam was unnecessarily high, but I'm not going to complain).\n\r\nAlso, the book is unnecessary.\n\r\nI would have given him 4 stars but if you try to ask him questions right after an exam even if it's unrelated, he will yell at you. He is also very condescending sometimes. Even if you have a legitimate question he will cut you off and say \"I'm not answering those questions right now\" or \"I can't solve new problems for you right now\" or \"that's not relevant to the topic\" even if a) it's a general conceptual question, b) you're not asking him to solve a new question, and c) it is relevant to the topic. Golub many times (not always) assumes that his students are idiots and comes off as being extremely mean and as someone else has said, his head can be very far up his ass.\n\r\nFinally, when you're taking a test, make sure to get your question across if you have a legitimate question. Many times the TA's too (and Golub) may think you're fishing for the answer even when you're not. This has happened so many times it makes me want to smack them and tell them to listen to my damn question before cutting me off. You're basically on your own.\n\r\nAlso I don't know what the other people are smoking who gave him 5 stars.

Another time he gave everyone in the class 5 extra points as a \"curve\" but admitted that he had not yet calculated the average.

Sometimes the lectures are clear and well-made, but mostly he uses in-class recordings from a couple of years ago, which can be frustrating to watch because of poor audio. The actual content of his lectures are OK though, and I'd say he's overall a decent lecturer. \r\n- The class sessions are used to go over assignments and any extra ramblings. This flipped classroom approach seems nice at first, but the problem is that he assigns a quiz that is due before every class, so you pretty much have to dedicate an hour or two before the class to actually watch the lecture and take the quiz, in addition to the time that you're already spending on homework assignments and studying. \r\n- Exams are crap. Averages are usually in the mid 50s, and make up around 80-85% of your grade (the rest of your grade comes from homework/pre-class quizzes). The fortunate side of this is that Kruskal grades with a huge curve, so you're usually not at risk of outright failing if you're doing about average. In the past, exams used to be based heavily on homeworks, but that seems to have changed this semester, with exams having new problems that are only loosely based on previous homeworks. He also seems to have added a number of different topics this semester that he doesn't usually cover, and this was particularly frustrating because many of the TAs and GSS leaders did not have any familiarity with the material at the tail-end of the semester. \r\n- He outsources pretty much all of his course operations to his TAs, aside from lectures and homework/exam writing. This was probably one of the most frustrating parts of the course, because the TA team is woefully understaffed and left most of our homeworks ungraded until after finals week. I do not understand how 330 had almost 20 TAs and 351 has barely 10, most of whom are other undergrads who have obligations with their own courses. Seriously, this is one of the most ridiculous parts of this class - please hire more TAs. \r\n- Kruskal himself is a nice guy and is flexible + willing to help. I would highly encourage people to go to the actual classes/lectures to stay engaged and to get help from him directly. \r\n\r\nTl;dr - Kruskal is a nice guy and a decent lecturer overall.

However, the course could've been managed better, and rubrics for homework's and exam solutions could have been much less ambiguous, as well as the questions on the exam. \r\n\r\nThere can be a time where you work with your friend on a homework, then you receive a 0/15 on a homework problem while your friend receives a 15/15 because the rubric is not as definitive and TA's judge based off their intuition and subjectivity. Same goes for exam problems, besides the fact that you obviously do the exam independently, you can have a solution that follows the gradescope rubric to earn a specific amount of points, but the TA can be subjective and not go off of what the rubric says and even give you a 0 for the problem for what should have been partial credit atleast. This may be a TA problem sure, but Justin leads the TAs and instructs them on what to do, so I feel there's a bit on him too as he could make the rubrics for homework problems and exams more definitive so TAs can't be as subjective. Exam problems were ambiguous as well to an extent, mainly the true/false portion, but some written responses as well, but the true/false was only a few points (typically 10 points an exam).

TA's most of the time if you had something not resembling the rubric in a homework assignment, or just because based on their own judgement, will not take their time to read your answer and will not hesitate to slash off as many points as you can as possible (Many times I have gotten back as much as 20%-25% of my assignment just because the TA did not read my answer entirely, and I've had to explain very thoroughly in my regrades). \r\n\r\nI know this is not his fault, but he was very aware of the grading issue because we would get multiple announcements about how there would be over 100s of regrade requests for each assignment and exams. This would not be an issue if the grading was more careful in seeing if the student truly understands the topic instead of how close it is to the rubric, or even something as small if simplifying 1 more step would give the same answer. Oh and what the other reviewer below said is absolutely correct, sometimes I would compare homework answers after grades came out on grade scope, and classmates who wrote the exact same I did would get full credit while I would get -50% off or even the entire question wrong. Same thing if they had the same reasoning for more deep thought questions.  Mind you sometimes you would have to regrade this multiple times to get your points back if the TA's were unwilling to check, and it wasn't for sure that you would get your points back. \r\n\r\nLastly the reason that also made me give him a not so great review even though I enjoyed having him a lot as my instructor, the above issue of getting massive hundreds of regrades because of extremely inconsistent grading, got so bad that during the last weeks of school after the final they said that since regrade request numbers are always hundreds, they would not allow regrade requests for hw12,hw13 and the final exam. Our homework is worth 28% of our grade and people were relying on this to bring up their averages if they didn't drop them, and they even admitted they graded the hw \"leniently\" and the rubric would even say \"anything reasonable even if not correct\". My questions were not read, marked off points without explaining any reason because of the shortness of time with regrades from past assignments, and the final exam also had some grading inconsistencies.\r\n\r\nMy final point, Justin throughout the semester said that the cut-offs would be lowered  slightly below the regular cut offs to account for the grading inconsistencies, the ambiguous writing of questions on exams and etc. This was only 1% or so when confirming when my friends, which if I will be honest, 1% of the entire class is not enough to account to how extremely bad and up to the TA grading your assignments judgement is. And even if Justin offered to contact him regarding grading on hw12,hw13 and the final exam, he would only do this if you were borderline.

As a result, we got all of Kruskal\u2019s exams and homework assignments which are notoriously difficult. Max did not have control over what was being taught and the difficulty of assessments since Kruskal was in charge, and as a result, he sometimes stumbled over content (it\u2019s hard to keep up with a mad scientist). It honestly seems like Kruskal and Max hate each other (understandably so) since there was a lot of miscommunication throughout the semester. To pass this class, this is what I did: I showed up to Max\u2019s lecture with the expectation of getting a simplified overview. I did have to supplement the content to keep up: Kruskal has pre-recorded videos that go into the content in depth, and I binge watched those videos and reviewed the homework\u2019s a few days before the exams. The exams feel similar to the homework assignments, but at the same time they are different, so it felt like a big wildcard, and I found it better to just YOLO the exams than to stress about them. My mantra: take inspiration from the homework assignments and express your creativity on the exams. I had no idea what I was doing on any of the exams, but try to grab the \u201ceasy\u201d points and think on your feet. \r\n\r\nMax as a lecturer: he\u2019s naturally charismatic and has a geeky sense of humor. I feel like he genuinely wants the class to pass. Even though at times Max was confused, at least he was enthusiastic while being confused? He would drop hints about the exam topics during the review which was helpful to dial in on, and his encouragement to keep us going while we were all flopping was helpful. At the end of the semester, his cutoffs were a lot more generous than Kruskal\u2019s.

In conclusion, Kruskal is the villain and Max was forced to join the dark side.", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "B-", "created": "2023-05-29T01:05:15.660070Z"}, {"professor": "Maksym Morawski", "course": "CMSC351", "review": "Maksym's 351 was co-taught with Kruskal, and this whole class was basically run as Kruskal's class with Kruskal's homeworks and exams. Max was forced to co-teach with Kruskal, in which Max was not very happy with as far as I know, because Max had little to no control over the material. Kruskal and Max were both discontent at each other, because Max didn't want to follow what Kruskal does.\r\n\r\nI think Kruskal's material is fine. His homeworks are definitely hard, but if you go to the TA's or especially Kruskal's office hours, they will explain what the problems mean. And that's really it, Kruskal's problems are all about understanding of the material. What this problem wants us to do, what this algorithm does, why this algorithm behaves such a way, what this problem accomplishes, and why this problem is relevant, etc. If you really understand that, then Kruskal's 351 homeworks and exams will come off pretty easy. As for the notorious last \"coding interview\" problem on the exams, if you can do Leetcode medium without difficulty, you will do well :). But jokes aside, these \"interview\" questions get a lot of hate because there's really no way to prepare or study for these questions, but like I said, if you understand what this problem is trying to accomplish, then they should come off pretty easy. It's all about critical thinking, testing you whether you can come up with an efficient solution, and you will get partial credit even when you write a brute force solution. Kruskal doesn't want you to write 50-100 line of code that does complex stuff, the solutions to his coding problems are always simple pseudocode. Kruskal may be very disorganized and just not good at administering class, but he is seriously one of the most knowledgeable people in the faculty, and you will learn a lot when you go to Kruskal's office hours. He's been teaching and researching algorithm and theory for decades, and it shows.\r\n\r\nNow, onto Max. Like I said, Max wanted to go with Justin's material to teach his class, so him being forced to follow Kruskal's material was probably stressful for him. I'll give him credit for trying his best. He's definitely someone who wants his students to pass the class, although that is not evident in his teaching, but in the curve. He gave a lot more substantial curve than Kruskal's even when Kruskal's curve was pretty large, which was about one letter grade difference, although the pass/fail cutoff was comparable for both of them. Does Max teach well? Well, that's another matter.\r\n\r\nI think the problem with Max is that he severely lacks knowledge on the material. It's not that Kruskal's material is different from Justin's or whatever, he just doesn't know the subject well enough to lecture it. I'm sure Max is very competent when it comes to an actual practice as an engineer given his career, but I think his teaching is very shallow, although he has potential to improve. I definitely think Max wants to become the next Justin, someone who is approachable to his students, explains the concepts well, and have the majority of his students get an A. The thing is, I barely learned anything from Max's lectures. Pretty much the entire knowledge I learned came from Kruskal's recorded lectures and his office hours. The difference in the level of quality in answers you get from Kruskal's office hours and Max's office hours is pretty significant. I definitely think that Max will improve a lot, but I can't say that I learned a lot from him.\r\n\r\nDespite the co-teaching, there is a pretty huge difference in the philosophy of teaching 351 between Kruskal and Max. Kruskal emphasizes in thinking about the problems and how to solve them creatively. The problems may be challenging, but you gain so much once you solve them. The way Max seemingly wanted to run this class is like a standard class, where you just take notes and you can do well on the exam just from the rote memorization. The difference in the philosophy of the subject is probably why Max and Kruskal were so unhappy with each other. I personally think that critical thinking and understanding is much more crucial rather than simple regurgitation when it comes to algorithm and theory. This is probably why I learned a lot more from Kruskal and give him more credit than Max. But I think Max has a lot of potential and I definitely do see Max as a good lecturer in a few years.\r\n\r\nOne thing I will note about 351 is that it is very poorly structured and Max did his best for his first semester teaching it. It's not about exams taking 80%+ of the course but really more about the content of 351. 351 is too much math and analysis heavy, and I do wish the class teach more interesting stuff like dynamic programming instead of spending too much time on sorting algorithms, constructive induction, and NP etc. The way Kruskal structured 351 is pretty unique and arguably odd compared to algorithm classes at other CS schools, so I can definitely feel Max's frustration in having to be forced to teach that way only. But then again, the whole CS curriculum at UMD needs some fixing.", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-05-29T09:35:11.381315Z"}, {"professor": "Clyde Kruskal", "course": "CMSC351", "review": "I was in Maksym's section, but both Kruskal and Maksym co-taught 351 and the class was run pretty much exactly like Kruskal's class except for a different curve, and having been to Kruskal's lectures, office hours and studying his material for the bulk of the semester, I figured it's better to write a review for Kruskal's class here as well.\r\n\r\nI think Kruskal's material is fine.

You won't do well on the exams from rote memorization and regurgitation. The problems may be challenging, but you gain so much once you solve them. I don't think Kruskal's 351 is impossible. What decides on your performance in this class is psychological. If you approach this class by just mindlessly taking notes and cram the night before, you are not going to do well. If you rely on simple memorization, you are not going to do well on the exams. Also, getting 65 and 70 is a good thing. Whether this grading system is a good idea is debatable, but don't stress about the raw score just because you were used to getting scores of 80+. It's all relative, and I don't think it's a bad thing. The interview question at the end of the exam, which is something not a majority of the students get full credit in, is also accounted for, and the class is heavily curved. The pass/fail rate for Kruskal's 351 is also comparable to any other CS classes.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm saying is that you don't need to be too scared when going into CMSC351 with Kruskal. It's really not that bad, and it has its reputation because the class is just, different. CMSC351 is one of the first CS classes that requires you to think critically unlike 100 level and 200 level classes. If you figure that out, you will do well.\r\n\r\nOne thing I will note about 351 is that it is very poorly structured.

Some are recorded in the classroom and the video quality isn't great, but some are great, very clear, and with helpful slides.\r\n- He is apparently helpful when you go to office hours in person.\r\n- The class is pretty tough but there's a decent curve at the end that takes it into account.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- His in-person lectures, unfortunately, are not great. He spends around half the class on tangents about unrelated things, and a good chunk of the other half is spent on going over the homework. Going over the homework is great, of course, but I found he spent a lot of time on the things that weren't as necessary to explain in detail, and not a lot on things that were necessary to explain in detail.\r\n- The fact that we had to watch both recorded lectures and in-person lectures meant we were supposed to spend almost twice as much time on 351 as on normal classes. Eventually, I stopped going to in-person lectures, but that did mean missing out on answers to past homeworks/quizzes/exams.\r\n- Some concepts are overcomplicated, such as recurrences (the whole president/vice president/supervisor thing just made it harder to understand)\r\n- He also often doesn't tell you the intended answers to tough quiz/exam questions when discussing the quiz/exam afterwards.\r\n- His responses on Piazza were often not very helpful (he found it hard to understand students' questions)\r\n- Administratively, the class is a mess. There's not enough TAs, it takes a ridiculously long time for grades on anything to come back, instructions on homeworks are often unclear.\r\n- The final exam is a huge part of your grade.\r\n- He soemtimes uses terms with his own definitions, so when you Google it, either nothing relevant pops up or it turns out everyone other than Kruskal uses that term differently.\r\n\r\nOverall, not the worst professor ever, but take someone else if you can. The fact that his class is harder does NOT mean he is a better instructor and you'll learn more - you'll have to do a lot of self-studying.

Nobody takes Kruskal willingly. You are only here because you have no choice and you do not want to delay taking CMSC351 to next semester to get a better professor (which you could if you plan it right, but I never did). \r\n\r\nSo here is what actually matters which is advice on how to survive Kruskal / what I would have done differently if I could do it again: \r\n\r\n- Give up all hope that you will be helped by TAs / Kruskal office hours. TAs will either be very kind and nice but not know anything, or just find it very funny that you are suffering, or not show up. As it is there are not enough TAs for anything. Kruskal used to be helpful in the past apparently (as per previous reviews) but these days is just very snarky and refuses to even give a basic response in the right direction. Sure Kruskal you can't just give me the answer but I would have really appreciated if you just guided me in the right direction otherwise what's the point of coming to your office hours?\r\n\r\n- Go to lecture the first week, then never again. It is a waste of time.\r\n\r\n- Take those three hours you free up each week, add three more, and MAKE SURE YOU GRIND HIS ONLINE RECORDINGS LIKE A \r\nMANIAC. This is your new religion, make sure you MASTER those videos.\r\n\r\n- Join the dominant Discord server for the class.\r\n\r\n- Take the thrice-weekly multiple choice quizzes as an opportunity to make sure you learn from the videos and watch the videos (as he intends you to). Do NOT do something like try to do them at the last minute by coding up the sorting algorithm or asking your friends, the most important thing is that you master the videos. \r\n\r\n- Your friends in the Discord server are your only resource and hope. Share all your homework answers with them (don't worry it's allowed) and make sure they share with you. If your friends don't want to do that then join another Discord server or find new friends. \r\n\r\n- Post on Piazza if you want but estimate only a 10% chance of actually getting useful information in return. \r\n\r\n- If falling behind, ask for an extension on Piazza for whatever (he is generous with that on a whole-class level at least, so be bold and ask). \r\n\r\n- Religiously practice the homeworks done before each exam. Remember that the exams, including the final, are NOT CUMULATIVE. Kruskal will never clarify the syllabus but it will be based on the practice exam (x1) and the homeworks that immediately precede that particular exam. \r\n\r\n- Do not worry about your quizzes, they are worthless anyway (0.2% each, lowest dropped). It's a red herring, the biggest fish to fry are the exams (2 midterms, 1 final, all two hours each). \r\n\r\n- The class is graded on a curve, the median is B- one standard deviation above is cutoff for A (or A- I forgot), one deviation below is the cutoff for passing (getting a C-). \r\nThe only indicator of your progress the entire semester that you should insist and fight for (everything else give up on) (forget about it, you're not getting that homework graded before the end of the semester) is the statistics for the exams. \r\nEnsure that you are within one standard deviation from below for the class to pass.\r\n\r\n- Accept that 50% is the average. Literally 50%, if that is the median, will get you a B-. I don't know why everyone worries about this, this isn't your Nelson class where you can get a perfect score on every exam.

A lot of the questions on his exams ask you about certain techniques covered in his lectures and homeworks, others are more creative algorithm questions but if you miss those, it's fine. A lot of people do, and since the class is curved, missing those doesn't kill you. I could go on and on about Kruskal, but to sum it up, he's a smart old computer scientist who can help challenge you to become a better computer scientist. It's possible to do well in his class, you just have to work hard.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A-", "created": "2024-01-22T08:04:10.032761Z"}, {"professor": "Justin Wyss-Gallifent", "course": "CMSC351", "review": "GOAT", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2024-01-25T21:28:19.210500Z"}, {"professor": "Justin Wyss-Gallifent", "course": "CMSC351", "review": "He\u2019s known as the GOAT for a reason.

His first issue is that he is basically a glorified substitute teacher for the better professor who is Justin Wyss-Gallifent. All Max does is rehash his notes in a worse and confusing manor. He also takes the homeworks directly from Justin, so you begin to wonder what he actually does. Then when the exams come around you find out this is the only reason he wants to teach. He likes to make his exams as difficult and unorthodox as possible. He will put questions that were not remotely covered in class as he teaches the material from Justin's notes word for word and then tests us on questions he personally likes. The other problem is he puts very little effort into it as he just generates the questions using LeetCode then lets his TA's attempt to convince him out of giving some of the terrible questions that are generated. My main issue is that there is no textbook or notes provided from Max to learn how to do these weirder questions that he asks on the exam. Maybe for example if he made his own homework instead of just giving us Justin's, then we would be better prepared for his exams. Due to this 'co-teaching', which is basically copy and paste from Justin, we are prepared for Justin's exams and not Max's exams in the slightest.
