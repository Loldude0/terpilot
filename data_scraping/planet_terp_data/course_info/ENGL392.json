I have just a couple points.\r\n1) Schatz's grading in no way resembles how the grading is done in law school. Especially true for legal citations which Schatz is ultra critical about, but the law schools aren't. Indeed, I can discern no logical reason for the way he grades.\r\n2) Schatz grades on a worse curve than law schools do (Schatz gives about 1 A for every 25-30 students).  We are required to take legal writing first two semesters, but in the first semester, Berkeley doesn't even put our grades on the transcript because they knew legal writing has such a steep learning curve.\r\n3) This class only marginally helped me for my actual legal writing class.\n\r\nRegarding everything else, I think it's all covered pretty well in the reviews below.
