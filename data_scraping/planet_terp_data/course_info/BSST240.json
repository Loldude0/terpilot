Prof Sin is a very nice guy and he definitely knows what he is talking about. Your grade in the class is based on three group projects (two 10-15 minute topical projects and one 20 minute semester long project) that are very manageable. There is no homework, quizzes, or exams, just the group projects. There are readings but I didn't read any and passed with an A+. He does take attendance, but the classes are also recorded on zoom just in case you are not able to join in-person. Overall, if you need an easy DSNS credit (or DSNL if you take BSST241) this is definitely the class to take!", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2022-12-13T22:26:04.981913Z"}, {"professor": "Steve Sin", "course": "BSST240", "review": "Really nice and funny teacher.

Students will gain an understanding of CBRN Weapons, through the exploration of the scientific method, and certain fundamental principles of chemistry, biology, and physics. Students will also learn how to test hypotheses, use basic statistics, interpret results, and apply their new knowledge through discussions of practical applications in the domains of public health, emergency management, epidemiology, and threat assessment. Bringing these fields together in one class will allow students to better understand the use of and threat from CBRN weapons in terrorism.", "is_recent": true, "geneds": null}
