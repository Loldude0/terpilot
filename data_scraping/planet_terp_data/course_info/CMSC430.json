It was intriguing and Jose did an excellent job making it fascinating to learn about the compilers and interpreters, exploring how to incrementally add features, and connecting them to examples from his personal career writing compilers. \r\n\r\nSome of the key pros I would list are:\r\n1) Interesting assignments and final project options (Could be challenging at times)\r\n2) All lecture notes for the languages we covered were posted in advance before the course started (this was super helpful when preparing for midterms)\r\n3) Asynchronous videos were provided of him walking through the languages from past semesters (He started recording our lectures halfway into the semester but I think the asynchronous videos kind of made up for this.\r\n4) Jose and the TAs quickly responded to questions on Discord or ModMail and provided sufficient online & in-person OH.\r\n5) Expectations for programming assignments, midterms, quizzes, survey, and final project were reasonable. \r\n6) Regrade requests were available for Midterm 1.\r\n7) Enough time was given to complete the programming assignments (~2 weeks), quizzes (~1-3 days), final project (1 month), midterms (3 hours), and survey (1 day). \r\n8) Gave plenty of opportunities for Q&A during lectures \r\n\r\nOne very small con (only because of the staffing issue in the CS department this semester and larger class size) is grading overall took longer than expected. \r\n\r\nOther than that, I think the course was very well-organized and went according to the original plans and the TAs and Jose did an excellent job making sure all students understood the course content and how to apply it to assignments, etc. Strongly encourage anyone interested in compilers to take this class with Jose.

My biggest complaints were how unorganized the professor and staff were (Aside from the lecture notes that are from previous years), how horrific the communication was (dates would be changed, assignments would be posted and the only way to know was to constantly stress-search through the hundredddssss of discord posts) and grading was very unreasonable.", "rating": 2, "expected_grade": "B", "created": "2023-05-31T21:00:21.433481Z"}, {"professor": "Jose Calderon", "course": "CMSC430", "review": "I had Jose for CMSC216 and CMSC330 and CMSC430. \r\n\r\nThe first thing I want to bring up is that Jose is unlike any other professor/instructor at UMD (With the exception of Dave Mount). Not only does Jose know the ins and outs of everything he is teaching, but he has a passion for teaching what he knows. He'll make sure to give you an answer that is as fully correct as he can make it. He really wants his students to understand everything he is teaching and will go to great lengths to help them understand. His office hours are amazing and will really push the student to learn the concepts when they are struggling. He has helped clarify a lot of things for me especially in CMSC330 when the topics of NFA's and DFA's were killing me. He's also really funny and has a great sense of humor.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that CMSC430 IS A HARD CLASS. Seriously, it's really hard and a lot of people don't expect that because of Jose's amazing reviews (which he deserves). But it's important to understand that CMSC430 is essentially CMSC216 + CMSC330.\r\n\r\nIn CMSC430, you will get thrown into the belly of the beast with about two weeks to learn the Racket programming language (which is a Functional programming language). So yeah if you suffered and hated Ocaml in CMSC330, you're going to learn even more functional programming that has the most ridiculous syntax imaginable (lookup what a racket program looks like) and the most useless error messages possible (Highly recommend using chatGPT to see what your error messages mean. Saved me a ton of googling). However, if you were a fan of functional programming and loved lambda calculus then this class won't be that bad. It will be tedious but it won't be horrific. It also matters how many other classes you are taking at the same time because this class has such a heavy work load.\r\n\r\nProjects: The projects are the bulk of the grade in this class. But these projects are so much different than lower level cs class projects. You can dedicate a ton of time in CMSC216 and CMSC330 to try and pass every test. In CMSC430, don't waste your time. If you get an 89% on a project, it's not worth the stress of 5 hours in the middle of the night and the destruction of your brain cells to bump it up to a 93% especially when the problems in the code might be so minor where you really understood the concept the project was trying to teach you but there was a small implementation error. Trust me, getting an 80% on a CMSC430 project a few times is okay.\r\n\r\nWriting the assembly is not that bad. Just review and comment what each line does in your example programs and you begin to understand it all pretty well. It can get pretty tedious when you're writing a program in a function programming language where the job of the program you're writing is to spit out assembly code in a specific order. Make sure to read the lecture notes Jose gives, don't just watch the videos.\r\n\r\nAlso most importantly, don't cheat on the online exams. Jose will most likely catch you and you really don't want the stress of an XF or a 0 on an exam hanging over your shoulders. We didn't get our second exam back for 2 months because of cheating and some people didn't get told they were caught until after the end of the semester because they were doing a giant analysis to determine who was cheating. If you fail an exam, try again and study harder and go to him for help. I got a B on the first exam, totally bombed the second exam, and had about a B average for the projects. I got a really high grade on the final project and ended up with a B. \r\n\r\nIt's a class worth taking because I think it's essential to know how a programming language is made considering the fact that cs majors constantly use programming languages. It's gonna be a lot of work though.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "B", "created": "2023-06-23T15:12:47.935815Z"}, {"professor": "David Van Horn", "course": "CMSC430", "review": "Had him this summer for 430. One of the most well put together classes I've ever taken. Seriously. A lot of time went into the design of this course, so that you wouldn't spend hours and hours sifting through documentation for an answer. Most upper level classes will say its the students job to find out what functions to use to solve a problem, and what resources to get there. But everything you need for this class is in the notes and in lecture, so you can spend more time thinking about the theory, and doing projects then sifting through pages and pages of documentation. They even made a language to simplify x86 to only instructions that are relevant. On top of that, DVH lectures very well, attempting to explain those notes and boiler plate code with live coding examples. He doesn't just teach off slides he actually shows you what to do and tells you why he's doing it that way. Very good lecturer. But don't get me wrong this class isn't easy, you definitely will have to think your way through the projects and some projects I was just grateful to get a C. But I took it in the summer so maybe less time made it harder, I don't know.
