Wasted an entire month of my time saying he'd write me a letter of recommendation (which I had to write myself and send him) and only told me a week before my application deadline that he \"can still write it, but would have to adjust it and it would hurt me more than help me\". He gave us creative liberty to work on our capstone, but ended up making decisions himself without even notifying us then expecting us to deal with the decisions that he made. Hardly provided us with any of the materials we requested. Had unrealistic expectations of us and treated certain students differently than others. He is not very pleasant when dealing with students and had been badmouthing us to other students and professors on campus. Finally he was very demanding and when students kept saying no to voluntary events post-semester he kept trying to force them.", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "B+", "created": "2024-02-27T05:40:20.610841Z"}], "department": "ENST", "course_number": "472", "name": "ENST472", "title": "Capstone", "credits": 3, "description": "<b>Restriction:</b> Must be in a major within AGNR-Environmental Science & Technology department; and permission of AGNR-Environmental Science & Technology department.\n<b>Additional information:</b> This is the pinnacle course for students majoring in ENST and is therefore recommended in one of the students' final semesters.\nThis capstone course focuses on professional project preparation, presentation, and critical evaluation on environmental science research.
