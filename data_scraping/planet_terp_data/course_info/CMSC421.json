Attendance is required, which is questionable but tolerable because we only had to sign a piece of paper at first. Recently, the professor adopted an in-class quiz policy where we are required to take a quiz which is graded on accuracy as a way to show our attendance.

Also, I could spend forever explaining the failures of the assignments, but to keep this shorter, essentially the assignments are all new and not tested at all.

It seemed to have been designed primarily by 1 TA and when attending office hours or trying to get help the other ones would tell you to do something and the TA that made the project would be like why are you doing that\r\n- Deciding midway through the course to make attendance graded and surprise pop quizzes to force people to come to the lectures\r\n- Using piazza but the TAs and prof cherry-picking which questions to answer and leaving some unanswered for the entirety of the semester, regardless of whether multiple students ask the same question\r\n- Lack of coding examples in slides and lectures, throughout this class the only exposure to any code at all that we had was in the projects, and those were extremely vague and lacking documentation until the whole class was in anarchy and the profs and tas were forced to rewrite and clarify the project\r\n\r\nOverall I have thoroughly been frustrated and exhausted by this course in various ways.

You can probably find a synopsis of what happened online on Reddit or Piazza, but in summary, Tianyi Zhou managed to run the most disorganized class I have ever seen or heard of in the CS department. His lectures were terrible; they over-complicated every topic beyond the point of understanding. Even as somebody who scored comfortably in the upper quartile in the only exam we had in the class (and also on every assignment), the little content I did learn was entirely on my own and from resources he did not provide, and studying for the exam was an unpleasant experience that felt like searching for a needle in the haystack in terms of what I had to learn.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, his projects/homework assignments were extremely vague and looked like they were put together in about 15 minutes. The first coding project he released had so many bugs and the code base was so unworkable that it was extended by 6-7 WEEKS. When we eventually did have to submit it, the average grade was around 75% because the write-up questions (which had extremely unclear instructions at best) were graded extremely harshly by the TAs. The other assignments, while not as bad, were also graded quite harshly even though the questions were unclear.\r\n\r\nThe one slightly redeeming part of this course was the group project, but him and the teaching assistants (my group's TA was Hongyu Zhao) managed to completely butcher that as well. I will spare you the details of our project, but in summary after working on it for the entire semester and submitting weekly reports outlining our progress and methodology (which Hongyu admitted to not have read at all in office hours during the last week of classes), several of our group members talked to Tianyi after class about our project (keep in mind this was after the final lecture), and he told us that a core component of our project was being done completely incorrectly the entire time. This project was quite advanced and was adapted from actual AI/ML research in the field, so there was no way for us to know that we were doing this wrong, especially considering this was our first exposure to almost all of the topics involved in the projects. I don't understand how we only got notified of the issue around finals week when we have been writing our methodology consistently and in-detail throughout the semester. Hongyu Zhou also completely ignored our messages to him in the CMSC421 discord server asking for advice on this group project, even though he was assigned to us specifically to help us with the project. This was completely unacceptable behavior. \r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, Tianyi Zhou is a nice guy, very knowledgeable, and can provide good advice if you talk to him one-on-one. He would be a great research mentor. But to run a class where people actually learn, these are the minimum qualities you need to have, you also need to be able to prevent the things above from happening. He seemed to be completely oblivious to the chaos unfolding throughout the entire semester, I suspect he doesn't even realize at all the experience his students had in his class. He consistently acted like nothing was wrong.\r\n\r\nTianyi Zhou cannot be allowed to teach undergraduates anymore. I don't doubt he is very smart and valuable to the research department, but he is incapable of transferring that knowledge to his students. Just have any other professor teach this class and it will probably be ok.

Not only was it extraordinarily difficult due to poor lectures and low quality assignments created by TA's, but the teaching methodology used in this class was just completely inappropriate and set everyone up for failure.\r\n\r\nThe class began by teaching how to create neural networks from scratch. The difficulty of understanding neural networks did not just come from the fact that neural networks can be a difficult subject, but that there was little to no introduction to the topic. In fact, the first assigned reading from the textbook required knowledge from previous chapters in the book. Simultaneously, an assignment was given out with a very low quality code base written by a TA. It was one thing to listen to lectures about neural networks and read about it in a book, but there was no guidance on how to implement them from scratch. When we asked for resources, Professor Zhou gave us Pytorch references which helped in no way to complete the assignment where we had to build neural networks FROM SCRATCH. No Tensor Flow, no Pytorch for the majority of the assignment, just use Numpy. The assignment was so bad that it was given about an 8 week extension because no one had any idea how to do it and the TA's were not helpful. If I actually wanted to learn how neural networks are created, I could have just read a book on it in my own time instead of stressing over an assignment and I would have learned more.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the weights for the assignments in this class were pretty terrifying if you didn't have a grasp on some of the material. 60% of the grade was assignments (From 4 Assignments). We fell so far behind because of the mess from assignment 1 and the disorganization of the class instructors that assignment 4 was never released and the weights for assignments 1 2 and 3 became 12% 24% 24% respectively. So if you messed up on one of the assignments and didn't do well on the midterm, you were in some hot water for the class.\r\n\r\nThe only good thing I can say about this class is that we got a free 20% grade for attendance. However, this got taken away and replaced with in class quizzes because people complained it was a against department policy which sucked. Like come on, why do you all have to complain about the small good thing that this class provided. Would you have rather taken an exam for a class that where we barely learned anything?\r\n\r\nIt would be smarter to take the Machine Learning class instead of this.
