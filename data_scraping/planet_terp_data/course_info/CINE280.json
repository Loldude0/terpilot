Professor Arsenjuk doesn't really do anything or grade anything (except maaaybe the term paper). He just lectures and it is easy to tell he really loves film. The TA's are super nice and helpful. If you show up to most classes: easy A. The term paper is extremely easy to BS, and they were graded so quickly I highly doubt they were all even read thoroughly. \r\nBe ready to watch some dull movies that are hard to understand at 2x speed. Some of the assigned films are interesting, but those are dwarfed in number by the boring ones. \r\nIn all, great prof and little effort required.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2022-05-20T21:07:49Z"}, {"professor": "Valentina Rosales", "course": "CINE280", "review": "One of the kindest human beings I\u2019ve ever met.
