Her lectures are engaging and fun to be a part of. The lectures themselves are a little unorganized in terms of following along with the syllabus. She might not cover everything in one lecture so she probably will not test you on it. PowerPoint slides are posted on ELMS. I recommend printing these out because Alexander flies right through them during lecture. Dr. A makes an effort to learn many of her student's names (so watch out if you get called on in class). The class material is pretty straightforward and boring. Discussion sections are mandatory (turn in assignments and stuff). 3 midterms, 1 final, and 1 behaviorism project.

Alexander is awesome - she's a great lecturer and she literally remembers everyone's name eventually. She studies the class roster pictures and tries to learn as many names as she can before the class even starts. Her book is REALLY boring which is weird because her lecturing is interesting / funny. No cell phones or laptops allowed in her lectures though. Sometimes the topics are boring but she makes it as interesting as possible. Discussion is fun too- her TAs have been with her for years and are very helpful! There are exams, but not normal exams at all. A different style of test.
