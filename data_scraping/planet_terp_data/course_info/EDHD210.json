She is EXTREMELY scatter brained and it is impossible to follow her in class.  Not to mention she is extremely boring and sitting through a three hour class with her is pure torture.  She doesn't specify criteria for papers and is horrible and grading them in a timely matter and is a very hard grader.  She's very unresponsive to student concerns and I can honestly say that I learned nothing from her.

The grades are based off of a few \"essay\" type assignments but they are all straightforward and easy.  The content is interesting and she tells a bunch fo stories that really helped me understand what we were learning better!
