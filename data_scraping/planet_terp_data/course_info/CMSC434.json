The environment of the class completely revolved around his dislikeable centric personality. My group felt particularly terrorized in the sense that he seemed to be creating a climate of fear and instability all for the sake of flexing his perceived authority of the course topics. To expand on that, it's scary that he feels obliged to give some teams an F, and when he gives us the most abstract, ambiguous project guidelines I've ever seen in my entire life, with no examples of how we're supposed to follow them, it makes the grading feel completely unstable and up to chance. He seems oblivious to the possibility that there may be students in his class who have no experience in web development, or students with ADHD who can't sift through all his totally unstructured rules and instructions randomly spread across ELMS, lecture notes, and his personal website. Does he just think they're born to never succeed in his class and there's nothing anyone can do about it? Plus, his lectures are littered with irrelevant trivia about himself and his interests, which leaves behind an unsatisfying taste. He did express that he genuinely wants the best for his students, and I think there is some truth in that, but he clearly is too disconnected from the needs and desires of an average student to follow through on that. In a nutshell, professor Golub does way too much for an intro to UI class and he clearly can't comfortably handle everything he puts on his plate, which creates a vicious cycle where he lashes out by adapting an aggressive, unrealistic grading method to make himself feel comfortable again, and then his restored ego makes him inclined to put in even more effort. The feel of the class is sloppy and disconnected and is without a doubt the most unpleasant experience I've had in any class at UMD.\r\n\r\nI feel like all the problems with the course are reflections of outstanding issues in professor Golub's character.

To start off, his project descriptions are just one full page of text that's impossible to get any important information out of. Furthermore, the project guidelines are the most ambiguous and abstract guidelines I've ever seen. There are no examples to follow so it feels like you're always in fear of losing a ton of points. It's more than likely that you will do the assignment correctly but because of the confusing nature of the project descriptions, you will miss a few things that you needed to do. The purpose of organizing the project descriptions this way isn't to make it easy to do the assignment but instead, so Golub can have a valid excuse he takes enormous points off your assignment when you inevitably miss something. (I am talking about 25%+ for minor mistakes). \r\n\r\nThe second grip with this the professor, is his complete hatred of rubrics. If he had a rubric for his projects there it would be significantly more clear what he is looking for but since there is no rubric, no criteria to follow, and no examples of what he wants, you're basically going in blind and trying to follow the project descriptions as closely as possible. This would be fine if his grading wasn't so specific. There are things that he is specifically looking for but they won't be mentioned anywhere except for a passing sentence in the slides and are mentioned so quickly in the giant text of the project description. You'll have no idea what he wants until you get back your grades. \r\n\r\nThirdly, this might seem subjective but I am being completely honest when I say he is inconsistent with his grading. It's clear he picking and choosing points to take off and to keep on without reason. Two individuals could submit the same work and would get two entirely different results. Golub will take off different amounts of points for two individuals for entirely different reasons. It could be the same reason he will take off different amounts of points too. It's not even clear if he's doing this out of favoritism. And don't even bother trying to argue with him, since there's no rubric, there's nothing you can fight him on to get the points back. He'll come up with every excuse imaginable and sometimes even contradict himself in the process.\r\n\r\nFourthly, his classes are boring and irrelevant to the projects. He will spend hours on side tangents that have nothing to do with Human-Computer Interaction and won't even relate it back to the main topic. It's like he just wants to talk about it to show he is knowledgeable in that area. There are also attendance points discussed as participation points. They are given out at random so you basically have to come every day. His classes regularly go over the end of class and you always have to sit 5-7 minutes after when you're supposed to leave so he can wrap up class. You won't learn anything attending his classes and if you spend the entire class time on your phone, you wouldn't miss anything. \r\n\r\nNext, he is using way too many platforms. His slides and assignment on elms, we have to check our grades on the CS grade sever, he has his own website and to discuss our assignment with him on a separate Slack sever with 20 different channels. It's way too confusing and convoluted and he needs to condense the platforms he's using.\r\n\r\nFinally, towards the end of the course when other professors were wrapping up their courses to prepare for the final, Golub was still teaching new information. We had 3 midterms and 1 final exam and he was still teaching crucial new material that was going to be on the exam, one day before the final exam.
