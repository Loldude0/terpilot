Assignments - In Fall 2021 we had 6 assignments (2 written, 4 programming). While they are somewhat helpful in understanding the material, their length makes them really time consuming (more than expected for a 400 level class). For example, I remember writing 20 or so SQL queries where 10 would have been perfectly sufficient, and in general the written assignments were really long. They aren't necessarily difficult, but you definitely have to start early. One nice thing that I really appreciated was that Amol gives you 10 free late days (up to 5 on a single assignment). \r\n\r\n2. Exams - The exams are quite difficult, not in terms of content but more so in terms of time. If you had 24 hours to complete it, you could probably get 80+ assuming you understood the material. But with the time constraint, it was definitely very hard to complete all of the questions fully (the averages on the exam were around 60%). One good thing is that Amol puts a fat curve on the class. He didn't disclose the official cutoffs, but in the beginning of the semester he said that an 80% would be an A (i think it ended up being a few points lower). \r\n\r\n3. Content - This is probably my biggest gripe with the class. Amol tries to cover at least 2 semesters worth of content in this class. As a result, he moves extremely fast and tends to not explain things as fully as he can. For in depth explanations, he just tells you to read the textbook (which is decent). The content starts off at a decent pace, but after midterm 1 really picks up. I didn't feel like I was able to absorb anything meaningful because I was so focused on just cramming all of this information into my head to study. I also think that a lot of the content can be changed. We spend a lot of time learning about specific operations on disk, even though Amol prefaces the unit saying \"no systems actually do it this way anymore.\" He justifies it saying that this is still the foundation, but I personally found it very discouraging. \r\n\r\n4. Campuswire - This is maybe more of a personal issue, but Amol insists on using campuswire instead of piazza. I really hate campuswire (and I think the majority of the class did too). I find it harder to search posts, and you can't follow questions for when they've been answered.\r\n\r\nIn general, databases is a pretty dry subject so I don't blame Amol for the class being generally boring. One thing I really liked was that he was very responsive so you generally got a fast response to questions on campuswire. He did also listen to students' COVID concerns and had exams online (along with recorded lecture). There's definitely improvements to be made, so unless you are very interested in databases or need the class for a major requirement, I would avoid this class for now. \r\n", "rating": 2, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2021-12-24T23:56:34Z"}, {"professor": "Amol Deshpande", "course": "CMSC424", "review": "He gets a lot of hate but I don't fully understand why.

He would just plow through his slides which were pretty much just copy and paste from the textbook, but he wouldn't explain the content on the slides well. He would pretty much just end up reading it straight from the slides and then assume that we know exactly what it means, while on most slides there was always something he could explain more. This made the class really difficult when it came to exam time. There could be a question that was somewhat similar to the slides, and many students would still have no clue how to do it, which is a big issue. When you go to office hours, there have been multiple times where I've asked the different TAs the same question and have gotten a different answer, which made things even harder to understand.\r\n\r\nThe assignments were actually not too hard, just takes a lot of time, so you really have to set time to really work on it. Just getting a project set up could take 2-3 hours if your unlucky. Usually though, they are doable and you can get 90+ on all of them. \r\n\r\nWhile the teaching style was bad, you could get a 50-70 on every exam and midterm and still end up with a B/B+, so it ends not being the worst class.

There were no explicit topic lists released for exams, usually having to be put together by scouring many piazza posts.

It's hard to know where to start:\r\n\r\nThe review below touches on this, but the class is structured and managed terribly. The slides don't have enough information to rely on, but the lectures often weren't useful enough, so it felt like I was losing by going to class (I went to class every day) or losing if I didn't go. Some of the slides literally say to look stuff up online. There is a topic called Canonical Cover we \"learned\" where the slides said to look up how to do it, we didn't do any examples in class, and then we had to do Canonical Cover twice on homework and on an exam. Because literally everything in the class is on exams, there was even a case where something we learned in the last 15 minutes of class the day before the exam was on the exam. It makes it extremely difficult to study, especially because slides are grouped by unit, which means you have to sift through a ~250 slide slideshow to find any information. Furthermore, Amol does not provide good examples of stuff. The limited examples he provides are often copied and pasted form the textbook. I had no SQL experience before this class, but when we covered SQL he never really taught us how to write queries, he just sped through the syntax. This meant that I struggled on the SQL programming assignments.\r\n\r\nAssignments are doable, but often require a ton of time. We had homework and projects due within days of exams. At one point we had three weeks' worth of homework assigned simultaneously. He does schedule assignments they're all done before Thanksgiving, but as a result we'd only have 1-2 days of \"rest\" between programming assignments. Homework is your only attempt to get practice with the vast majority of the class content. The homework was okay, but he never provides answer keys because of his lax late policy. I'd rather have him be slightly harsher about homework deadlines so I can actually get feedback and learn from the homework, because the Grade Scope rubric often doesn't provide the feedback you need.\r\n\r\nThis class also relies on Docker, so if you have a slow/old computer, like I do, you will be miserable on the programming assignments. Just a heads up.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, this class was terrible. If you are completely new to databases, like I was, just learn how to use SQL or MongoDB on your own.

Each topic no matter how complex it is was gone through in such surface level so then we have to pick up extra time ourselves to thoroughly learn the concepts, especially canonical cover, and concurrency. For canonical cover, we were just supposed to look up an algorithm instead which was ridiculous. Also, the fact that we have to study I don't know a 1000 slides for an exam that can ask about literally anything is ridiculous too. I could be fine with all of this if the homeworks had detailed solutions after them. Some answers are just marked as \"Correct\" or \"Incorrect\" without giving us the full answer, and how we get to that answer. Also, as I mentioned earlier in learning the material on our own, examples were not given well at all. Examples should mimic homework difficulty so then we can learn from them and apply to the homework problems, not learning them in surface level and then having to take a lot of extra time just to do the complex ones. And with the late policy, official solutions can't be released, which I understand that. But if that's the case, then we need more complex examples with solutions so we have a point of reference.

He made an effort to personalize interactions by remembering and using our names. He encouraged questions and fostered discussions. It was evident that he cared deeply about the subject matter and his students. His enthusiasm was reflected in his attire as well, as he wore a suit to every class. Very caring.\r\n\u2014\r\n4. Was the workload appropriate for the number of credits? \r\n\u00b7 The workload was appropriate but slightly heavy, considering 17 reading quizzes (approximately 1.5 hours each), 4 projects (each taking 10 hours), and 2 exams (requiring 10 hours of study each). \r\n\u2014\r\n5. Was this course valuable or a waste of time? \r\n\u00b7 This course is highly valuable, especially for those interested in software engineering and data science/machine learning. Interacting with databases is a crucial skill in various careers.  He emphasized making 424 practical rather than overly theoretical. \r\n\u00b7 The first half of course covers advanced SQL, ER diagrams, schemas, normalization, and database building components. The second half focuses on theoretical aspects, considering memory constraints and algorithm costs. Cost considerations of queries was one of my favorite topics. B-trees are a significant topic as well. \r\n\u00b7 Projects 3 and 4 provide excellent practice working with large existing codebases. \r\n\u00b7 The TA's (Pooja, Cuong) contribute to the positive learning experience.\r\n\u2014\r\n6. How much support did you receive throughout the semester (office hours, extra resources, etc.)?\r\n\u00b7 Four hours of TA office hours were available each week, and the TAs were responsive to Piazza and willing to provide assistance with code privately.\r\n\u00b7 The professor had office hours by appointment (after class) and was always willing to explain clicker and reading quiz questions. \r\n\u00b7 He offered a bonus project to raise project grades and had a generous project late penalty.\r\n\u00b7 Three reading quizzes and three clickers were dropped. \r\n\u00b7 While the professor sometimes spoke quickly and didn't record classes, the classroom culture, energy, and support were excellent.
