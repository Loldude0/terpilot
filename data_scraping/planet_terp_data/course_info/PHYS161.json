Content is almost exactly what one would learn in AP Physics C mechanics, honestly wished I paid more attention then. First exam is pretty easy but it gets harder from there, even then I felt his midterms weren't that bad. On exams he does allow you to bring a one sided cheat sheet, so I found that to be helpful. \r\n\r\nDiscussions were honestly the worst part.  There's a quiz pretty much every week in discussion in the last 10 minutes of class, and obviously you would want to focus on that content during discussion, well you would be disappointed because our TA at least would just go over stuff from the next chapter and spend all of class doing maybe 2 or 3 problems even going into the last 10 mins. I tried really hard to pay attention but it was tough to follow along. Getting exams/quizzes back was very disorganized and we never went over any of them. Grading also took really long. This semester all the office hours were online and I tried going to one once but it seems the TA stopped holding them halfway through the semester, so I was pretty much on my own. There was some in person tutoring thing in the physics building I went to once (I did go day before hw was due so maybe that's why) but it was packed and the tutor wouldn't just answer the question and no one got it for hours, I ended up just figuring it out myself later.\r\n\r\nWe also got assigned a homework to complete every week, and it's pretty long. I would definitely recommend starting early (at the minimum a day or two in advance) because trying to do it all at once is really hell. I would also recommend finding people in your class to work with because it makes it easier and helps you through it emotionally as well lol. Last couple hw problems of each set were pretty hard in my opinion and def harder than quizzes and midterms so I would just try and answer it and move on without devoting too much time to really understanding. We used expertTA which could sometimes be really stupid and confusing but it does give you 5 tries, no points deducted, and the feedback can be helpful if it gives you any.\r\n\r\nI will also admit I sometimes skipped lecture, sometimes fell asleep in class, or just did not focus in class and here's what I found to be the secret to doing well. He goes over problems in class and posts the slides online. DO THOSE PROBLEMS BEFORE MIDTERMS AND QUIZZES. Follow along with the work to those problems and try understanding why those steps were taken. These problems seemed to be the most on level and usually weren't too bad. He does \"post\" the slides online but there's no answers. It is possible to find the answers to those problems online but sometimes its more confusing. I would recommend going to class and just writing down exactly what he does on the board even if you don't get it in the moment (sometimes I just took pictures but I ended up losing them in camera roll or just not looking back). If you keep this organized you can use it to study and it will help you a lot. Sometimes looking at the textbook may be helpful if you don't know a concept at all or you can try looking at videos online.\r\n\r\nFor exams I did that^ to study and wrote down all the equations and anything I would usually forget on my cheat sheet. I got an 88, 84, and 95 on the midterms this way. Most people fail the last midterm but I studied for like 7 hours at Mckeldin (probably shouldn't take that long but I get distracted easily) for it, looking over all of that^ for each chapter on the exam. I still never felt very confident after exams but I always answered each question and showed work because he does give partial credit. There's usually \"3 questions\" on the exam but each has like 3 or 4 parts and some parts were not even related (pretty much different questions). I did end up working pretty much till the end of the allotted time for every exam.\r\n\r\nThe final exam in my opinion was possibly the worst exam I've ever taken in my life. I had 2 exams that day so maybe that's also why but I was sure I failed. He allows a double sided cheat sheet for this and I wrote every equation that came up but it honestly wasn't super helpful. I probably could have studied more but I pretty much just re did all 3 exams and tried to really understand how to do everything (if you can get your hands on someone's past exam where they got everything or nearly everything right, USE THAT, because just going off his \"corrections\" is not good enough for figuring out how to do the problem and google did not help). I would recommend going over quizzes as well but I lost most of mine or just didn't get them back, and lastly look over the slides questions, and then if time do textbook stuff. The actual exam was \"6 questions\" but again they have parts. All of the questions were pretty hard in my opinion but I did attempt everything, and honestly BS'D my way through most of it. He looks at partial work so if you know how to do one thing and not the other just come up with something and use that in the part you know. I ended up actually getting a 71% on the final so...\r\n\r\nI had a 92.5 before the final was put in and then it went down to an 87% after. Hailu does not curve exams but he does drop your lowest quiz grade and if you're sick you can be exempted from one quiz as well. He does end up curving the class at the end so 20% of people get A's (A-, A, A+) all included, and after the curve my grade went up to an A-. What I've heard from people in the past is that after the final grades go up by ~5% so a B+ becomes an A-, a B becomes B+, B- becomes B, etc. \r\n\r\nTo wrap this up, this was my hardest class in my first semester in college so maybe my view is skewed but I think physics is just a hard subject overall. I've never had a good physics teacher to compare this to but this class has more to do with the amount of effort you put in than anything else. If you've taken physics before like me you can get an A by just putting in work when needed and hoping for the best. If you have never taken physics before I would recommend maybe doing AP mechanics stuff over the break before and putting in a lot of effort and time into this class.

I'm a physics minor, so I came into this class looking to learn something for my future classes but I'm afraid to say that I've learnt pretty much nothing in this course. The exams are difficult, and the homework questions are nothing like the exam questions so the practice you get out of the homework is very minimal.

I should've looked at his grade data for 161 more closely. My one piece of advice is, actually try and study for the third midterm\u2014everyone's going into this one thinking it'll be their drop one, some don't even show up and many people leave halfway after looking at the questions. Why should you study then? Because the curve for this exam is actually good, and it could bring your grade up. I know because I went in thinking I was gonna drop it, but I still studied and tried, and ended up with a slightly higher score than the first exam (which was the easiest of the three) because of the curve. I guess Buehrle prepares you for the final because you're exposed to the combined topic problems he likes to put on his midterms, but I can't say Hailu is better or worse because I haven't seen his exams. \r\nThe only other things contributing to your grade are homeworks (which can be long and difficult, but you get multiple tries per question) and the quizzes. The quizzes can be kind of tricky, and he only drops two so prepare for those. He drops four homeworks, but I would recommend saving those four drops for the end of the semester because there are homeworks due literally a couple of days before finals and nobody has time for that. So don't be lazy during the semester because you'll regret it if you have to do the ones near finals that are on topics you don't even need for the exam.\r\nAnyways I think this course was made more challenging than it should have been to get an A, so I'd probably go with Hailu.
