He loves seeing and talking to students and I can tell he is very passionate about his profession. He is very fair with grading and is willing to work with you and answer all questions. The only complaint about this class was the massive amount of materials we had to learn. Since it was in person, I felt rushed but he made sure to slow down and explain things. Since there was a lot of materials, the good thing was that he had reasonable expectations from us so he would tell us exactly what he was looking for in essays or exams.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2021-12-23T04:53:02Z"}], "department": "JWST", "course_number": "262", "name": "JWST262", "title": "Introduction to the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament", "credits": 3, "description": "<b>Cross-listed with:</b> ENGL262, HEBR298B.\n<b>Credit only granted for:</b> JWST262, HEBR293B, or ENGL262.\nOrigins of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), with attention to literary formations, archaeology, and social-political settings.
