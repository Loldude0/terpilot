This means that over time, he is going to become an even better professor as he drops things that didn't work and holds on to things that did.\n\r\nFor example, in 2008 someone commented that it was \"purely a slides class.\" A friend who took the course a couple years back also said it was very slide-heavy at the time. This semester, he used the slides sometimes, but didn't teach purely off of the slides. They played more of a supportive role, and oftentimes he didn't even use the slides at all and gave several real-time examples and the like.\n\r\nProjects were kind of a mix. I thought they were mostly fun, but toward the end the public tests dealt with nothing more than basic functionality, which isn't a bad thing, but you have to be aware of it and actually test your code. Practice exams, practice problems, and slides were sufficient for studying for exams, but I had to study pretty hard to get As (according to my browser, I visited the class website 226 times this semester).\n\r\nI know a lot of people care about this, so yes, there was a curve even though the raw mean was a 74.\n\r\nPotential drawbacks: I never asked for an extension in his class, but I did hear he was relatively unaccommodating about them. If you are taking this class at the same time as, say, a class with Meesh, and your life is hard, you should try to finish your assignments for this class on time and ask Meesh for the extension.

Sometimes he does get thrown off on a slide and gets confused or something, and sometimes he does blatantly read off the slides so going to lecture may not be optimal (he had lecture quizzes online so some people didn't really go to lecture, including me to be honest). The slides posted online helped me navigate through CMSC330 and helped build an understanding for each unit/topic we covered, along with understanding the whole purpose of the course. Sure, it may not be hard to post slides or he might have recycled them, but at the end of the day all the professor has to do is deliver information and make sure you understand it, and I felt like he accomplished that. The exams, quizzes, lecture quizzes, and projects of course were all online and open-note/internet as well, making it less stressful for students too.\r\n\r\nOverall, it was hard for me to pay attention in lecture at times, but that's just me. I sometimes even daze off even in Justin's lecture. Sometimes Cliff's lectures felt like \"I can just look at the slides when he posts them\", but then that turns into \"I have to look at 15 slides the day before an exam\" which i found myself doing a decent bit lol. I didn't give him a 5 star because his lectures are somewhat dull because he's monotone, and that makes it harder to pay attention, especially when you're already lost on some topic. He's very sympathetic, and has great potential to be a great professor though. Currently, I'd give him 4 stars, and for the future when he adjusts to lecturing, managing and leading courses, and overall improve over time, I'd say he's easily at-least a 4.5 star.

Some of the requirements felt more like tick questions designed to frustrate us rather than to actually display what we learned. \r\n\r\nThat said lectures don\u2019t get uploaded during the weekend; perhaps Cliff also needs a break over the weekend; however it would be nice to have something to reference when we have projects to work on over the weekends. \r\n\r\nIn any case, Cliffs lecturer's examples were usually inadequate and not clear; they were not a good foundation for these projects. \r\n\r\nThe difficulty between what we learn in class and the projects is too large of a jump, perhaps it\u2019s not that surprising considering they are just reused projects from other professors, who gave weeks to work on the same projects we are given 6 days for.\r\n\r\nThe lecture quizzes were quite a headache.

Unclear deadlines and typos in assignments, quizzes, and slides were extremely commonplace when taking this course. Even what material we were going to cover over the condensed course was questioned a lot by the instructors and TAs. At one point, they even outright lied (probably not intentionally) about what was going to be covered/not covered on the final exam. All of this had a direct impact on the class, and this run of CMSC330 had some of the lowest exam averages on record (the class was curved substantially to make up for this). Apparently, this was due to Cliff somehow not being told that the course was going to only be 6 weeks long instead of 12 weeks long, but I digress.\r\n\r\nAs a lecturer, Cliff was not the worst. He typed things out in Vim to demonstrate concepts, but he went fast and it was largely hit or miss if this approach beat out just sticking to dense slides. For instance, typing out code in Vim made sense, but once we got to NFAs/DFAs and grammars... Why not use whiteboarding software instead? One plus is that he'd post \"Lecture Recap\" videos for each lecture for those who couldn't make it to class. Although, these videos would often be posted 3-5 days after the lecture they covered, so relying on them to keep up is ill advised.\r\n\r\nWhile I didn't personally go to in person office hours (both in person and online OH were offered), those who did described the TAs as \"rude\" and \"bothered by questions.\" This doesn't affect my evaluation of Cliff himself, but I felt that it was worth mentioning and pointing out that this is unacceptable behavior for TAs.\r\n\r\nOverall, I would still recommend taking courses with Cliff over many alternatives simply due to his approachable nature as well as his modern online approach to teaching. He is still young and can only improve with experience and I believe Cliff has the potential to be a good professor.

It is very active, he asks a lot of questions of the class. We go through a lot of examples, and most of the lecture is Jose writing or typing out examples. If it's an interactive or syntax-heavy topic he will usually have an interpreter or compiler on his laptop on the projector. If it's more of a conceptual topic he's writing examples out on paper.\r\n\r\nHumor is subjective so some people may be annoyed by his humor, as well as his pet peeves. If you say \"method\" when you mean \"function/procedure/...\", he will say \"what do you mean 'method'?\" or similar. Same thing with statements vs expressions. I agree with him on the importance of being precise in wording and preserving the actual meaning of words (as long as that is their meaning, though meaning can change through change in use, but functions are NOT methods). Some people may be annoyed by this.\r\n\r\nDo note that it is not a big thing, and from what I remember it's basically just \"method\" and \"statement\" that comes up in 330, and they're pretty important distinctions. To me it feels more like he focuses on things that are dangers to your mental model understanding of the concept. Not understanding the difference between statements and expressions would be bad for your understanding of languages that focus on expressions and mutability. For some other topics loosey-goosey mental models seem to be fine by Jose, where the loose model doesn't harm your understanding.\r\nHe's not a nitpicker.

And he's smart. But there have already been so many unclear things this semester, leaving a lot of the class frustrated.\r\n\r\nThe first quiz was rough. The median score was 11.5/20. The reason for this is largely the fact that we had only 20 minutes for two write-in coding portions, plus other fill-in-the-bubble questions, a few of which were annoying trick questions.\r\n\r\nProject 2 was worse. The description was imprecise, and I had to turn to Piazza to understand what exactly he wanted, which nobody should have to do. Not to mention the fact that it was far too difficult for a project that was primarily intended to test your knowledge of regular expressions. I had to give up after spending my entire Friday night & whole day Saturday on it, while still failing two semi-publics. I've never had to do that in the past (granted, I had Larry Herman for my past two project based classes, who is probably way TOO descriptive). The most difficult part of the project also had nothing to do with any new content, and everything to do with (a) understanding what the heck we're even supposed to be writing, and (b) basically recursion stuff, which we all know how to do, but which was further complicated by various things Cliff had done to intentionally make the project more difficult.\r\n\r\nThere have been several other things. One is that, up until maybe the day before the first quiz, the syllabus had said that quizzes were open-note. And they weren't. Next, navigating his slides are like navigating fields of landmines. The slides have like three layers to them, and you can go up, down, left, or right. Which is further complicated by the fact that the slides appear to have a mind of their own, and they'll shift to random places when hitting the left or right arrows, when all you want to do is go back or forward one slide.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Cliff's saving grace is the fact that he, and his large army of TAs, respond fairly quickly to Piazza posts. And he has notes online that have basically all the content, which is a plus. He is not a terrible lecturer at all, and he knows his stuff, which can't be said of everyone.

The semester started with him using slides (which were really just visual aids for him and didn't serve as useful notes), but devolved into him just typing notes into Vim later into the semester as he talked. Lots of time wasted trying to spell correctly. Publishes decently useful notes.\r\n- Exams: Two midterms. Usually pretty fair if not easy. Usually hits you with a couple really ambiguous multiple choice or true/false but he double majored in philosophy so he likes things abstract and theoretical. Cumulative final.\r\n- Projects: Some were really, really hard. Others were fine. Lets you submit as many times as possible. No grading on style-- just tests, and usually these are all public or a mix of public and semipublic. Secret tests were on a couple projects but not most. As a result, they took a long time, but as long as you were able to get through it, they were easy guaranteed As.

With the project documentation, even outside of the dreaded project 2, the README's consistently left out important information which I needed to scrub through Piazza to get.  With administration, projects were pretty much developed on the spot as far as I'm aware, as the autograder was consistently released well after the project start date, and project 8 had a massive delay.  Both of these factors make projects much more of a pain than they need to be, as development problems are more often something poorly/not addressed in the README rather than programming logic errors, and \"semipublic\" testing is delayed until the autograder is up.  In addition, while ultimately minor, the lectures were honestly fairly boring and disorganized, as many of them are freeform coding/drawing sessions, but the coding particularly doesn't work because much of the time is spent on coding instead of getting across the main points.  Finally, 20 minutes for the quizzes just feels too short, and 25/30 minutes seems far more reasonable for the assessments they are.\r\n\r\nFor the good, besides the project 8 fiasco, the TAs, Cliff, and Kauffman were all fairly active in responding to Piazza inquiries.  Most of the projects themselves, except for the infamous project 2, have all boiled down to reasonable implementations.  The lecture quizzes were fairly useful, and the amount of forgiveness on them was really nice (I missed one by accident and still got full credit for lecture quizzes).  Exam weighting made exams not overly stressful, and the exams themselves were incredibly fair, which was nice after taking some past exams with fairly memorization-heavy questions (like coding an OCaml parser from memory).  Finally, Cliff and the TA's seem to know when things were screwed up, such as with quiz 1 and project 2, which is reassuring.\r\n\r\nOverall, you will likely do well with Cliff.  Exam averages were around 85 across the board, and nothing seemed too unreasonable at the end of the day (well, almost).  I think he's middle of the road right now, but chances are with a bit of fine tuning, he'll turn out to be a great professor.  Hopefully things get sorted out, as I understand the course is going through some growing pains right now.  At the end of the day, I would still recommend Cliff.  That is, if you had the choice, as CS class registration is in a terrible place right now.\r\n\r\nOne more thing, I didn't really like Rust as the final language of 330.  It kind of just boiled down into a mess of language rules, and the rust projects were not as effective as the OCaml projects in getting us acquainted to the language imo.  The original plan was to tack on Racket, and honestly, I would have much rather had that instead of Rust, as I feel it ties into the themes of the course much better.  It also has the side effect (get it) of preparing us better for 430.", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-12-20T00:05:30.880621Z"}, {"professor": "Christopher Kauffman", "course": "CMSC330", "review": "Kauffman is a great dude, and I really enjoyed his lectures.
