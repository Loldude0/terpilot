The homeworks are 10 questions that can go up to part m. They are so unimaginably difficult that many graduate students cannot solve them. I've been to tutoring, and it has taken people in doctorate programs days to solve them. It will take at the very least 4 hours to do a single homework.

Problems are gone through in minutes on the slides, and she spends time on bizarre substitutions and derivations for the entire class before chucking you into the deep end. Problems and variables are substituted so much that if you look back at the slides you won't be able to even see what happened. Nothing is explained in a legible or understandable way, important and critical steps and explanations are skipped with the assumption you can just figure it out, and you often leave the class in a daze trying desperately to figure out what just happened.\r\n\r\nThe tests are impossible. Literally, she said she designs them to be ridiculously hard. The only silver lining is they're based on the slides. She says \"Oh don't worry guys there's a big curve!\", which ranges from either half-true to a downright lie. Some tests do indeed have a curve, a curve so small it barely changes anything. Some she just won't curve at all.\r\n\r\nThis is the worst class I've ever taken.
