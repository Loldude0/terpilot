She does not teach the coding in class, but she does record tutorials and its especially not that bad if you know how to use Google. \r\n\r\nCoding assignments were once a week making a graph from a dataset. Aside from coding assignments, all other work was very easy, just a paragraph reflection and meme based on the readings for that week.

Dr Croco is incredibly kind and passionate about what she does and comes to dorchester events to meet the students. She is the best. People really just hated on her because the course had coding assignments (which are so easy...and I HATE computer science). The class is literally so easy.

If Dan is your TA you will be in luck, an amazing guy who is super helpful on all R assignments. The code can be hard to get the hang of and made me want to drop Honors but once you get over the learning curve you'll realize that Dr. Croco is right about all the benefits of knowing R.  \r\n\r\nDr. Croco does try to incorporate student input and make her classes more engaging.

HGLO101 forces you to learn how to code with R, and Dr. Croco does not give much instruction on what to do.

She is very engaging and friendly and it is very obvious that she actually loves what she does. \r\nRegarding the class, the work load wasn't hard when it came to the reflections and readings. The books were not that bad although some were very boring reads. My BIGGEST complaint about this class was learning R and the coding assignments for it. When I tell you they are bad, THEY ARE BAD. If you are not into tech, it will be a huge struggle. Dr. Croco was great at teaching everything BUT R. She didn't know how to explain the work and when you asked her for help, she would tell you to either collaborate with others are look it up online (which didn't help because R code you would find online is too advanced for this class). I feel if a professor is recommending you to use Chat GPT then something is wrong with how the class is being taught. \r\nI would say this class overall is 3/4 stars just because of how bad the R assignments were.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-12-15T17:29:11.779278Z"}, {"professor": "Daniel Tuke", "course": "HGLO101", "review": "At first, I wasn't a fan of Dan because of how he taught. He was very laid back, but in an \"idc about anything\" kinda way. But after the first couple weeks, I started to really like him. This form of teaching actually helped when it came to discussion topics because a lot of what we learned in HGLO101 is about the current state of the world. He is very real about what is happening and isn't afraid to call out and speak up against what we read. He is very entertaining and understands college students well which makes it really easy for him to connect with us. He is really funny and in the end, I liked the way he taught.

Sometimes she would assign like 200 pages of reading a week, which was annoying but that was so easy compared to the coding.\r\nIf you have never coded before, this class is going to be very difficult for you. Dr. Croco is very bad at teaching R. She doesn't give any support and expects us to know a lot right from the beginning. The pace we move at is so unbearable, and often Dr. Croco doesn't even know stuff. She tells us to use ChatGPT and google a lot, but those offer such immense resources that it is difficult to even know what to Google.
