The class was pretty alright, but I think it could have been better. Definitely not just an easy gen-ed, he treats it like a real cinema/film course.

The grading was fair, but the professor is simply not the best lecturer which was frustrating. Also, a lot of people didn't participate because he didn't facilitate participation. Often when someone would participate, he wouldn't say much, so the discussion started and ended with that one person. Exams were easy. He is very accommodating so that was nice.

Also he often started class a few minutes late while people trailed in, and a major plus: the exams are open note. The essays were okay (one was 1-2 pages, the other was 3)--short but analytical.
