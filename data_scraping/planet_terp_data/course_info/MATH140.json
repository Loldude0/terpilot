I\u2019m not completely comfortable writing that statement, cause she\u2019s such a sweet lady, but it\u2019s true. If you\u2019re signing up for classes right now, and if you still have the opportunity, I\u2019d recommend switching to another one. \r\nGulick has extremely high, unreasonable standards for how you show your work. She seems to have a set of highly specific criteria in her head that you must meet, but she doesn\u2019t feel like sharing with you until after you\u2019ve made a mistake. I\u2019ll give an example. \r\nThe first test given out in the class I got all the questions right. All of my final answers were correct, but Gulick managed to nitpick my grade down to a C- because of arbitrary rules that any reasonable math professor would laugh at. For example, I had nearly completed a problem, and was just simplifying my answer like this (I have the work in front of me): \r\nh = (3+9)x(4+5)\r\nh = 12x20\r\nAnd, in my final answer, I had my result in a box\r\nH = 240\r\nDespite 240 being the correct answer, Gulick took off 50% of the credit for the problem. Her reasons were as followed: \r\n\u201cYou simplified 240x to 240 without showing x = 1\u201d \r\n\u201ch=/=H\u201d\r\nSo apparently, she only accepts work that solely uses parenthesis for multiplication. You can\u2019t use a little x to show multiplication. Despite x not being a variable in the problem, she felt that it could be confusing for someone looking at the problem as to how the variable x appeared and disappeared. A friend of mine lost points for using a little dot to do their multiplication because it could be mistaken for \u201ctaking the dot product\u201d despite dot products not being a part of the problem or even part of the entire course. \r\nI also lost points because I capitalized the h when I gave my final answer, which is apparently a completely different variable in her eyes. She also takes off points if you don\u2019t indicate what the final variable is, so if I simply wrote \u201c240\u201d in a box to indicate my final answer, she would have marked off points for  not indicating what 240 is equal to. \r\nIt can be extremely frustrating losing so many points to arbitrary rules and small mistakes which most professors would ignore (you can lose full points off a problem for a simple algebra error) which can be pretty devastating when tests have five to seven problems. It can be really tough to meet her unrealistic expectations for displayed work for tests when you\u2019re struggling just to finish just in time. You usually just don\u2019t have time do all the work and quadruple check your work for small errors. The intended satire in this video is pretty close to truth for Ms. Gulick. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsvLLKQCxeA\r\nThe website that Gulick uses to assign homework, webassign, can be equally as finicky as she is. Lots of homework points can be lost to webassign not being clear in how it wants you to give your answer. \u201cOh, you wrote that the answer \u2018DNE\u2019 for does not exist rather than \u2018N/A\u2019 for this problem? 0 points.\u201d And then two problems later \u201cOh, you wrote N/A for this problem? The answer was clearly DNE. 0 points\u201d Actually, it doesn\u2019t do that. The website offers no feedback or advice. It\u2019s often a matter of just hoping that the website accepts your answer. The website frequently crashes as well, which can be pretty frustrating when you\u2019ve got a limited amount of time to complete it. Take a look at some of the comments here: http://www.isitdownrightnow.com/webassign.net.html\r\nAnd that\u2019s really just her grading style. Gulick frequently skips algebraic steps while doing work on the board. She\u2019ll go straight from something like: \r\n((((6^2 * 10) + sqrt((5000*3) - 600)) / 4! ) * 4 ) - log(1 * 10^11) = 69\r\nAnd then move on to the next problem, which can be rather confusing if you\u2019re a minute behind or so. \r\nFurthermore, she does focus heavily on proofs, which is great for understanding problems conceptually, but not so great when both the webassign questions and the tests focus heavily on application problems. Her lectures are hard to follow which makes her very frequent pop quizzes (which she calls \u201cwhite papers\u201d) all the more stressful. \r\nAll that said, she\u2019s a nice lady, and very approachable. She\u2019s got a corny sense of humor and is very willing to help you out if you need it (and you\u2019ll probably need it, since she\u2019s not at all clear in class). She\u2019s a really nice person, but a terrible professor. \n", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "", "created": "2013-12-13T20:27:00Z"}, {"professor": "Frances Gulick", "course": "MATH140", "review": "Horrible.

This makes a lot of sense; they demonstrate clarity of thought and a straightforward presentation of the material.  Unforunately, her rigid concern for this sort of order invariably leads to a sacrifice of precious class time which could be used for review and practice.  She incessantly emphasizes the importance of the short class time, and then proceeds to waste it with proofs.  While I find the proofs interesting and useful, they tend to confuse and frustrate the majority of the class, to the point that while most of them started out fresh and eager to learn at the beginning of class, they were tired and worn by the end of it.\r\nShe assigns internet homework after every lecture (before and imediately after tests not included), and expects the student to practice a good deal of problems recommended in the textbook.  To paraphrase Frances from her class syllabus, you CAN do well in her class but it requires a LOT of work.\r\nThis is due largely in part to the rather strange format of the tests.  There are generally 5 questions, with mutliple parts to each question.  Regrettably, the paucity of test questions leads to a proportional increase in point values per questions.  If you make a mistake on part of a question, you can easily lose 5 to 10 points.  Coupled with the single point losses for careless error throughout the rest of the test (which are common, because they are so thorough and lengthy), the grade for a test that you were well-prepared for can easily slip into the 80's.\r\nWebAssign, worksheets from discussions, and in-class quizzes are collectively a huge part of your final grade.  Frances compensates for her exams by allowing a great deal of points to be made up elsewhere.\n\r\nMOST IMPORTANT PART:\r\nThe tests are relatively straightforward, without much mathematical innovation necessary.  She is the math teacher for people who work hard, but don't like math (despite the counter-productive proofs during lecture).

For people who have never taken calculus and this is the first course you will be taking, you want to AVOID PILACHOWSKI at all costs. His teaching method is quite possibly the worst fit for a math class. The way he teaches is by clicking \"Next\" on a 10-year-old PowerPoint. In lectures, he does not really explain anything or take any questions or do a real practice problem or show the steps or any of that. He does none of that at all. The way you learn math from a good teacher is by them showing you an example and giving you a step-by-step process on how to solve that specific problem in the future so that you would know what to do with that specific type of problem. Rather, he just reads word for word the complicated boring textbook definitions of terms in his powerpoints that never make sense to anybody. So to the general masses, unless reading word for word textbook definitions is how you learn math, his lectures are utterly useless. Now it would be unfair of me to critique the grading because all 140 classes have discussion worksheets and web assigns due each week graded on accuracy so even though that's a bit harsh, it is not his fault that's the way the coursework is given at UMD. What I can say however is that HE DOES NOT CURVE any of the tests even if the majority of the class fails or gets low grades. The most he does is drop a couple of the lowest discussion worksheets and hw assignments at the end of the semester which will not even impact your grade (1-2%maybe at most).

He is for sure not the best that you can get although I won't say he is absolutely terrible\u2014 he gets the job done. I took AP Calculus AB in high school which resulted in me getting significantly above the average on all the midterms and on the final exam but I can definitely say that if you have never taken a Calculus course before, you will have trouble in this class.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- The final exam is EXACTLY the same as the previous couple years' final exams. Like pretty much identical but different nambers. If you practice about 5 of them from the UMD math test bank, you should have no problem at all on the final. In my opinion (and reflected by the scores), the final exam is the easiest exam of the all the exams you will take in this class by far. This is important because the final is worth nearly 30% of your grade in this class.\r\n- Midterms are pretty easy and fair. There is always a topic or two for each unit that was never covered in AP Calculus though (ex: Newton-Raphson Method, and Delta Epsilon Proofs\u2014 in my experience at least), so you definitely need to study for this class, even if you've taken AP.\r\n- TAs for this class are generally helpful, even if they aren't necessarily yours. \r\n- With some classes, you can get away with not going to discussion, but not this class. During every discussion there is a worksheet that you do with your table that counts for a grade.\r\n- Homeworks are on WebAssign and they are pretty easy and are good practice.\r\n- There is a lecture outline for every lecture and makes it pretty easy and straight-forward to follow through.\r\n- Pilachowski ends up dropping your lowest couple homeworks and discussion worksheets to help your grade. He also cuts your lowest midterm exam score in half so it is worth fewer points in the final calculation. For example: if your lowest midterm is a 70/100, it will be changed to a 35/50 which helps your grade by about 1 or 2%, which is helpful if you are close to the next letter grade.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- My worst complaint about this professor: he spends SO MUCH TIME at the beginning of EVERY CLASS talking about absolute nonsense. Pilachowski is infamous for hating bikes and electric scooters and will come into class with a new anecdote about how he almost runs over someone EVERY. SINGLE. CLASS... He also has general messages that he repeats every. single. class. which were helpful for maybe the first few weeks but even during the last weeks of the semester, he was reminding us to \"mAke SuRe YoU PuT mAtH140 In ThE sUbJeCt LiNE of EaCh EmAiL oR eLSe I wILL nOT rEaD iT\" or \"mY CLocK iS SeT tO ThE tImE iN cOLorAdO\". Not to mention that at the beginning of every class, he states \"I think I will get through chapter ___ today\", but then he doesn't and tells us to read the textbook or watch the lecture video online... Maybe if he didn't talk about the most irrelevant nonsense during the beginning of lectures, then he would actually finish teaching.\r\n- Like every college course, exams are everything. In this class specifically, you will take one diagnostic test at the beginning of the year, 4 midterms, and one final which total to over 80% of your overall grade. Each midterm is 12.5% of your final grade. Study hard for these exams as they will make or break your grade. One bad exam can drop you letter grades.\r\n\r\nOverall, pick someone else please. Save yourself. Pilachowski is an option for MATH141 which I am taking after MATH140 but me, along with almost everyone that had him for MATH140, are making sure to pick someone else. Pilachowski can get you by but overall, that's not the only job of a professor.

To sum it up, I found him pretty difficult because he focused more on theory and made difficult exams. Homework was pretty time intensive and I did not like his personality (he came off as very condescending to me). He couldn't stop bringing up his girlfriend in lectures. I could've taken him for MATH 141 next semester, but I decided to choose a different professor because he did not know how to teach (not that any other professors are much better. The math department sucks at UMD).\r\n\r\nWhat the class consisted of:\r\nThree lectures a week and two discussions a week. Every discussion, we would have a 10 point page worksheet, that was difficult in it of itself to complete. If I didn't know people in my discussion or have such an amazing TA, I would've failed all of these worksheets. It's really important to get a good TA for discussions because while my TA was extremely reasonable and helpful, I had some friends who their TA would give them a 0 out of 10 on these worksheets because they made one mistake.\r\nOnto the lectures, I felt so lost during all of them. He talks a lot about theory, which causes his lectures to absolutely make no sense. Even when he talked about concepts I've already learned, they made no sense anymore after he went through them in lecture. He also was never early. If he wasn't exactly on time to class, he would either be 5-10 minutes late. I also didn't like his attitude. He had a dry sense of humor, which came off as very condescending.\r\nWe had homework due every Tuesday and Thursday morning (due at 7:45am so you basically had to do it all the night before). These homework's were quite often long and tedious. Before I had a solid study group, it would taken me up to 5 hours to complete them (reduced to 1-2 hours with a study group). Because he mostly talked about theory in lectures, he was no help when it came to being prepared for homework. I had to teach all of the concepts myself to be able to even complete just the homework. Also, he didn't record lectures, not that it made much of a difference though since I didn't learn much even from going to lectures.\r\nHis midterms were difficult, more so than some other professors. There were 4 midterms, all of which he wrote (a few of them also had questions about useless theory that no one paid attention to). I had about an average of 72% cumulative for all the midterms. The only exam I really did well on was the second exam (intro to derivatives and I got a high A). The worst exam for me was the third exam (applications of derivatives) as the class average was a 52%, because the questions were unrealistic for the amount of time we got.  Keep in mind that I studied for a week for all of these exams. The only thing I will say about his exams is that there were a lot of problems that were taken straight from the textbook, so if I could go back, I would pay more attention to the textbook. \r\nI found the final exam a lot easier than most of his midterms. I still studied for about a week, but I was able to an 89% on the final whereas I only had one midterm that I scored above an 89%. The math department writes the final exams, so they were very similar to a lot of the past final exams on the test bank (and Mackall wasn't the one writing it so that made it more manageable).\r\nFinally, even though he said there wouldn't be a curve for anything, he did end up curving the final grades and a 61% became a C-.", "rating": 2, "expected_grade": "B", "created": "2022-12-17T19:09:18.438173Z"}, {"professor": "Denny Gulick", "course": "MATH140", "review": "If you take him, he has + or - which other teachers don't have, so take that into consideration.

I have enjoyed being in his class and the one thing making me from going off the rails is my TA. Chadwick lets you know that this course is not going to be easy.

The midterms are hard, but he gives a midterm from the previous year and a sample midterm before each exam so they prepare you very well. I have had friends in this class who self-study and do incredibly well without having to go to lectures. Professor Chadwick makes the effort to answer questions and is genuinely a nice person. The web-assigns and discussion worksheets he gives are fair, BUT are harder than what we have covered in class (they aren't really good review material, but if you work well with other people in your class it should be fine). The quizzes are similar to class notes. Speaking of notes, although he does cover everything that is in the textbook and curriculum, he tends to skip steps during class due to time so if you need any clarifications, speak up! He sometimes goes over time but the most I have seen is him going over the time by around one or two minutes. He will tell you what is on the exams and what is not on the exam, such as particular proofs that he teaches you (proofs won't be on the exam and you don't have to know it for any exams, but he has said that it is good to know). \r\n\r\nOne helpful thing I would say is to go to his office hours whenever you get the chance or whenever you do not understand anything. Also, take good notes as they are helpful. Calculus 1 isn't that bad if you practice and take the time to learn or even ask questions. There are a lot of resources online to help you if you do not have the time to go to office hours. Plus, Chadwick gives you extra problems from the textbook for you to practice with. The web-assigns are similar to the problems on the textbook too. Everyone can do well in this class if they put in the work.\r\n\r\nOverall, Chadwick is an honest and prepares you well for the final. He does curve a little bit for the final as well. If you have taken AP calculus AB or BC before, that background knowledge can be decently helpful, but as usual, the AP calculus courses doesn't cover everything in calculus as calculus 1 in UMD covers some things you might have not seen before, and a lot of content you recognize previously in your AP calculus class. Personally, Chadwick's class goes as fast as AP calculus BC. Although I was able to keep up with his lectures, I am aware that some others are unable to keep up with his teaching and what I can say about that is to practice or even watch videos to try and understand. On midterms, he does give out partial credit unless said so otherwise (for example: on one of the midterms, Chadwick said that if we did not get the derivative correctly, we will receive 0 points on that question, which is honestly understandable, I don't know how you're getting through calculus with the wrong derivatives). All in all, he does a good job teaching and doesn't get enough credit for it.\r\n\r\nShoutout to my TA for being the best and the most helpful :)", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "", "created": "2022-12-24T00:04:21.165802Z"}, {"professor": "Steven Chadwick", "course": "MATH140", "review": "For everybody saying this guy is an amazing teacher, is lying.

So if you already have a strong understanding of Calculus, you should do okay. If you had never taken Calculus, it will be a struggle for you.

Hands-down, Professor Chadwick was the worst mathematics teacher I have ever gotten. Accompanied by the fact that I have never learned Calculus in my life, his explanations were dull and his methods of teaching were non-existent. In fact, it got so bad to the point where I never showed up for class and had to learn derivation and other topics all on my own. Even for students who have taken calculus in high school, he does NOT teach and you will be sitting in a room for an hour and 30 minutes that consists of him doing textbook problems on his own and talking to himself. On that note, his method of \"teaching\" is to just translate the whole book word-by-word verbally which helps literally no one. He often skips steps on problems and rushes which leads to a lot of questions. As for his responses, they are all so convoluted that it makes everything more confusing than if he would have just ignored questions altogether. When he asks students if they understand, they would nod their heads and just stay silent for the remainder of the hour (or year for that matter).\r\n\r\nChadwick does NOT curve, mostly does NOT offer partial points, and does NOT record lectures. One more important thing to note is that Chadwick's exams do NOT have any WebAssign problems nor any resemblance to the study guides he gives us. Do not expect to succeed unless you have taken Calculus before and even then, it's still difficult to pass. Every positive review about Chadwick is, by assumption, a student who has taken Calculus in high school or someone who failed and is trying to get others to fail alongside them. Again, to reiterate, I have never taken a year of Calculus prior to Chadwick and only by sacrificing marks of other classes and using external resources did I manage to pass.\r\n\r\nNow onwards to the Math Department as a whole. Math at UMD is so comically difficult that it should be considered a cruel and unusual punishment. They do a terrible job at writing exams relative to the time students spend on each topic/chapter. Students have other responsibilities, however UMD math still continues to assign weekly quizzes, biweekly exams, and unforgiving WebAssign due dates (7 AM every Tues/Thurs). Not to mention that WebAssigns on average take 5 or more hours to finish because of the nature of the problems.

Anyways, whoever they are likes to make all of our lives a living hell and give problems way harder than the ones practiced in class or on the exam.

Dr. Chadwick is a good professor. He tends to read straight from the textbook, which can make things a bit confusing, along with being somewhat monotone, making it challenging to pay attention sometimes. However, he does post his notes on ELMS, along with being more than happy to help students whenever they ask a question. Whenever someone asked a question in lecture, his face would light up, which is a really good sign that he likes what he does and really cares about his students. The practice exams are also very similar to the midterms he gives, which I have found to be quite helpful. Additionally, the work load is manageable, and it is very helpful for preparing for exams, however the homework is annoying since its on WebAssign, which doesn't offer any explanations if you get an answer incorrect and only gives you 2 attempts, but I know that isn't Chadwick's fault. What is annoying is that it only counted for 2-3% of the final grade. Additionally, the final is a common final, and even after doing many previous finals for MATH140 along with doing Chadwick's previous midterms and practice midterms for practice once again, this semester it was much harder than the previous ones, and although I did very well on the midterms, getting a mediocre grade on the final dropped my grade from an A- to a B+. Chadwick also cuts your lowest midterm in half, not completely dropping it, which is helpful.

Lots of assignments but that\u2019s just expected for a common math class like MATH140. There were worksheets, online homework through WebAssign, written homework, midterm exams, and the final exam. The WebAssigns were more to assess and make sure you understood how to do the material, the worksheets are harder but will be more of what your midterm questions will be like, the written homeworks are kinda miscellaneous but they\u2019re important to your grade. If you put effort into this class and get help from office hours, the tutoring center in Kirwan, or just online help, then you will be fine in this class. Don\u2019t slack off on the exams.\r\nBreakdown:\r\n- Worksheets (20), 10%, they\u2019re done EXCLUSIVELY only in discussions, and you must turn it in by the end of it, otherwise you won\u2019t get points, so don\u2019t skip discussions and do your best on it. You can always talk and get help from classmates if you need to.\r\n- WebAssign (28), 12.5%, anywhere from 8-15 questions per section. These are usually due at 7:30 AM on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and usually address the content that you learned the day before when you had a lecture (Monday, Wednesday, Friday).\r\n- Written Homework (5), 15%, THESE ARE WEIGHTED PRETTY HIGH. There are only 5 of them, so take them seriously. The first 3 are on your own and you have to submit both online through ELMS/Canvas and the day it\u2019s due in discussion. HW04 and HW05 are group written homeworks that are you guys doing practice exams leading up to the final, so get with your group early.\r\n- Midterm Exams (4), 37.5%, these are all weighted equally, so don\u2019t worry about the 1st exam being weighted more than the 4th exam. He will provide you with a past practice exam for each exam, and if you want more practice exams, just email him if he has any more. As long as you study the notes and worksheets, you should be fine.\r\n- Final Exam, 25%, study a bunch of the practice exams beforehand, go to his office hours, go to your TA\u2019s office hours and you should be ok. Make sure to read the questions.\r\n\r\nProfessor: I think Kendall Williams is pretty good. Some people may say he moves slow, but that\u2019s not necessarily the case, it\u2019s just he explains every part of the example problem that he does. The examples he does in class are very well explained, any questions that you need just raise your hand and he will explain it in depth how he got there to make sure that your question is answered and that you understand it well. He doesn\u2019t post his notes so you should go to class otherwise you probably won\u2019t know how to do the material or know what\u2019s going on unless you\u2019ve already taken Calculus 1 in the past and understand it well. He emails back pretty quick, his TA\u2019s are pretty good (shoutout Jacob). Also has a sense of humor, if he doesn\u2019t get to the material in class, he will push back the due date for the WebAssign, and is very professional all around.
