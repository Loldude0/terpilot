I initially took THET285 because I was told it was the \"easier\" and \"more fun\" class that gave comm credit. Shortly after the class started, I realized it was completely memorization. Every week, we had to do a show and tell presentation where we had to write and memorize a short speech about an item. We also had to memorize a 6 minute poem (specifically the poem given at Biden's inauguration. Later on, we had to memorize poems, and other speeches we wrote. Yes, it's not super hard to get an A, but the class itself does not help much, especially not with writing or structuring speeches. We got almost no help writing our speeches, as the entire class was based around memorization. This is a common opinion among most students in the class, and all of us felt we would have been better off taking COMM107. This class caused us all a lot of stress and anxiety. Another thing that was really annoying was she would write while you are giving your speech, which was pretty distracting. The professor is pretty nice (but pretty intimidating) and was able to adjust to people missing class when they were sick. But overall, the class itself really was not worth it at all. Even people with a huge interest in theater in our class regret taking the class, it really was not theater related.", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2022-12-08T04:45:53.638460Z"}, {"professor": "Ronya Anderson", "course": "THET285", "review": "Prof. Anderson is very nice and clearly knowledgeable about public speaking, but she falls short as a professor.

We also had to memorize a few speeches and recite it. And Wednesday classes were chill and had some writing exercises and for some weeks we did not have a Wednesday class at all. \r\nThe class itself was pretty easy and straightforward.
