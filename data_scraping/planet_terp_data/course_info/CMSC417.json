I strongly advise to wait a semester or two and take this with a different professor.\n\r\nI'm not writing this post as sour grapes either I performed pretty well in the class, I just started the semester really excited about learning about networks and in the end it all got sucked out of me.\n\r\nThe worst part of the class, the professor, and the TAs is that they create an environment where it feels like they genuinely want you to fail. If you ask about what content will be on exams (you will have no idea what will be covered) the only answer you will get is \"read the chapter and do the problems.\" FYI chapters are 1-200 pages of thick, technical textbook with 40+ questions each and exams cover 2-3 chapters. \n\r\nI get that college is a lot about being able to teach yourself material, but you shouldn't have to teach yourself an entire class, especially a class as complex as Networks. \n\r\nProjects:\r\n- the first two projects were completely useless busy work that consisted of making simple client-server model. At no point in the class do they help you or show you how you would create such a connection (they just go over it on a high level, much different to actual C function calls), you literally just have to figure it out yourself. Not to mention, you have to use CORE, which is a nightmare within itself that even after the class I still have no idea how to use it. The second project is more about \"can you parse in C\" than it is about networks... Idk about you, but I didn't take 417 so I could waste my time tediously using strtok()\r\n- The final project is actually pretty cool - you implement some real deal stuff and you will learn a lot as a result. I wish they had you do practical things in Ruby all along as opposed to just at the end. Also a bonus that you get to work with a partner\n\r\nAll in all, you WILL learn a lot if you take this class, only because you literally have to memorize a textbook to pass. I did not come to college and pay tuition money to memorize a textbook, however. Professors should make it easier, not harder, to understand material and they should genuinely care about your success - Agrawala is neither.\n\r\nAgain, I did well in this class and I am not writing this because I am sour - i genuinely want you to either not take this class with Agrawala for your own good. If you do, I just hope he has magically improved and changed since.  All things considered, there is no doubt Agrawala is brilliant, he's just not approachable and not a good teacher. Twice I went to office hours with course content questions and for advice and twice I got the answer \"read the textbook\"... not very helpful. \n\r\nCraziest thing is, if Agrawala changed a few things the course wouldn't be so miserable for everyone.\n\r\n1. Provide some kind of study guides for the tests so we know of the hundreds of protocols what to focus on\r\n2. Provide suggested book questions for each chapter so we don't waste our time doing 40+ problems. There is no reason why he can't give 10 questions per chapter or something like that. \"if it's not on the slides don't worry about it\" doesn't help at all\r\n3. Hold some kind of seminar at the beginning of the semester outside of class that introduces students to CORE and how to get set up properly\r\n4. Stretch the last project to be semester long and have students complete it in useful increments (maybe even add a bit to it)\r\n5. Act genuinely interested in the success and well being of the students as opposed to creating an environment where we feel like Agrawala wants us to fail", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "", "created": "2016-12-18T13:11:00Z"}, {"professor": "Ashok Agrawala", "course": "CMSC417", "review": "I think the professor was actually a good teacher. He asked questions to get us to think and to understand why things were the way they are. I will say that the lectures were sort of dry, especially if you read the book. But the point was to get us to learn the basic concepts, and then we would study the details ourselves.\n\r\nI'll admit that the projects weren't entirely connected with the material in the lecture. But to say they were entirely irrelevant is false. I think the previous poster didn't really understand the point of the projects (considering they stated how it was just locate the standard library function and do it in this way, because that wasn't the point). It was to help us to understand how protocols work, and in that sense, it was connected to the material in lecture. But the final project was the most important. It really showed how hard network programming is, because you have to account for so many things, so it's much harder than say, Operating Systems. The final project was meant to help us understand that every decision in networking has some sort of reason behind it. And it does have real world use. So that gives me the sense of accomplishment. It was meant to simulate a real-life project as well, as it took a lot of coding and testing, and you had to work with your group members. I had a group member who only wrote ~200 lines of code or so, but the reason I didn't say anything was because the fact is that we do have other classes, despite this being like a real-life job.\n\r\nI will agree that the lack of study material or review for exams was disappointing, but there is a reason for that. It's hard to make questions that students can solve in a reasonable amount of time that adequately test student knowledge, thus questions are reused. I'd just recommend studying the questions at the back of the book. It is a vast amount of information to cover, but that's how a lot of courses are.\n\r\nOne thing I do agree is that it would've been better to add a reading schedule. It would have helped a lot.\n\r\nOverall, I would say I learned a lot from this course. I learned that understanding networking means understanding communication in general. I learned that there is a reason for every decision in a RFC. The professor also taught us that what we needed to learn is how to learn, because this information will soon be obsolete, and that's something important for CS majors in general.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "A-", "created": "2016-01-05T19:42:00Z"}, {"professor": "Ashok Agrawala", "course": "CMSC417", "review": "Agrawala was a horrible professor, and 417 was a horrible class.\n\r\nThis was possibly the worst computer science course I've taken yet at this university.\n\r\nUnlike most other 400-level CS classes, that teach relevant and useful technology, this course seems to be mostly based on obsolete material. The projects don't convey any meaningful skills, and while in other classes I typically can look back on the projects and feel a sense of accomplishment, in this class, I felt like I jumped through hoops. (I got 100% or 90% on all the projects, so this isn't sour grapes -- the projects were just bad.\n\r\nFurther, the projects and lectures seemed entirely disconnected. I felt as if I was taking two different classes where two entirely different things were being taught. Lectures didn't prepare us for projects in any sense. As such, the projects weren't challenging, because they had to be easy enough for us to teach ourselves how to do. This meant that the projects consisted entirely of \"locate the standard library function to do this thing, and invoke it in the right way.\"\n\r\nThe lectures were almost entirely taken from the textbook. If any reading had been assigned, this would mean that people who did the reading would get nothing out of lectures. The lectures were presented in an extremely dry and boring way. The lecturer would occasionally ask either extremely simple factual questions or incredibly complicated questions. Nobody was willing to venture an answer, because there was obviously a right answer (which the students didn't want to get wrong in front of the class), and in the simple case it seemed like the instructor was asking a trick question, while in the complicated case the students weren't sure of themselves. The instructor would, after doing this, chide the class for not participating. Further, the instructor would never revisit old or important material.\n\r\nThe exams were entirely disjoint from the lecture or projects. The two midterms focused almost entirely on concepts that appeared on one or two days of lecture. Further, the instructors refused to give students any information about what would be on the exam. This forced students to study huge amounts of information, including large parts of the textbook (which was tested on the exam, even though no readings had actually been assigned and there was no reading schedule for the course). Most students probably gave up; those that didn't were equally unprepared, because the exams were, rather than general, incredibly specific. The only way to get a good grade on the exam would have been to study in huge detail every aspect of the course. Typically, courses that require this have clear focus and direction, but this course had neither. It was like taking a survey of 1990's networking concepts and technology.\n\r\nOverall, taking this class was a vastly unpleasant experience.

I spent more time for this course than for most of the core 4 credit CS classes.

There were also 5 exams throughout the semester. Marsh said at the beginning that this courses bad wrap is due to it being \"one of the hardest the department offers\". I don't think the difficulty is the content, its entirely with how the course is organized. The lectures do not coincide with the projects, so for more than half the projects you'll be looking at text books learning the material to execute the projects.

I think Bobby's teaching philosophy can be somewhat debatable, so I'll mention what can be done better: [-]: negative or can be improved upon. [?] Depends on your perspective. [+] Undisputable good quality\r\n\r\n[-] Not recording lectures or office hours: I think the whole idea behind this is that when people know a lecture is being recorded, they stop attending class. Although this is true, we have to see if this is a good thing or a bad thing for the students. It might be demoralizing for the professor since he might not be able to interact with a class and you could argue this is bad for the students since some students are lazy and fall behind schedule because \"everything is recorded\". So let's analyze this in detail: [+] Bobby provides OH \"relectures\" for people who missed the class. [-] Bobby does not record OH even if people have other classes during the time of OH and sometimes refuses to discuss what was mentioned in detail because he \"discussed it many times in OH\". [-] Some students like me usually will rewatch lectures to fill in missing gaps in our knowledge, not having lectures recorded means we have to go on Piazza but given the next bullet points this isn't so \"smooth\". Overall, I think if Bobby wants people to attend lectures, he should find a way to take attendance and leverage it in part with the participation grade. \r\n\r\n[-] Being demeaning to the students: This is an area Bobby needs to work on for sure. You can't go out there and call people stupid or get annoyed when people can't grasp concepts easily. I've seen instances where he literally said \"this is a stupid question\" even when the question was somewhat relevant. Maybe this might be why he doesn't record.......\r\n\r\n[?] Not giving previous exam solutions:  This is probably a blessing in disguise. You are forced to learn where and how to find the information you need instead of having them given to you and just learning through pattern matching. I think this is a good thing but you can easily argue this is a bad thing.\r\n\r\n[?] Projects take up too much time: The tradeoff is that the projects are cool and useful on your CV. If you take this class, you should be informed that it is hard and a lot of work. Don't make the mistake of taking this with other hard classes.\r\n\r\n[+] Great Lecturer: Bobby can explain concepts well and you get engaged rather easily\r\n\r\nOverall, Bobby is your stereotypical grandiose narcissist who has a valid reason to be narcissistic.

His lectures can be very engaging since he is highly knowledgeable, funny, and interacts with his class often, but whether it be on piazza or in lecture, he will berate you infront of everyone; although; will help you nonetheless. Bobby is a cool dude and does have a soft side, It just sucks because there are more instances where he is hella rude than decent. There was one instance during a zoom OH where he openly stated a question was stupid and forced another student to answer it instead. Although I did say he can be rude to everyone, I have noticed that he is kinder to smarter students that don't irritate him. \r\n\r\nWith regards to the actual course: this class is essentially two classes at once: the lecture side will cover things on the exam, but the projects are completely self taught. Bobby will not teach you how to code sockets, instead he will provide sources and then you have to figure it out. Do not take this class if you are not confident in your coding ability YET. MAN pages will be your bible. There are no recordings, and the class notes are the scribble scrabble he does during lecture. \r\n\r\nAll-in-all: I do think you should take this class. I know my grade and review says otherwise, but you WILL learn a lot if you take this class, and it definitely forces you to become a better programmer. If you are going to take this class, make sure you have the time to give it your all. Most importantly - become a competent programmer before taking the class if you're not already. The final project is a group project that is still based on individuality, so if you end up with super smart people in your group and end up getting hard carried - that's two letter grades gone.\r\n\r\nTLDR: the class is a semester long suckfest, but is worth it in the end.", "rating": 2, "expected_grade": "D", "created": "2023-01-11T07:22:38.742458Z"}, {"professor": "Samrat Bhattacharjee", "course": "CMSC417", "review": "Bobby is a nice and good professor, but the projects in this class are the worst.

Only Chord and BitTorrent had a lecture dedicated to them, and those lectures were essentially useless to implementing the projects. He gives you 2 weeks to complete the project, and I can attest that you will need every minute of those 2 weeks. Project scores required 15-20 hours to get a 50% in my experience. There are no public or release tests given, and the rubric in the assignment does not match the grades i.e. the first project said you'd get an A if your server could handle multiple clients. Mine could and I got a 55% because of some corner cases I didn't test with my client, NOT my server.\r\n\r\nThe only saving grace in this class are the exams. With a cheat sheet or open note they're actually doable. I usually was 10-15% above the class average on the exams, which if there is a curve should help me pass this class.\r\n\r\nOnly take this class if you are <=14 credits including it (as I was at 17 and this class is easily a 4 or 5 credit in terms of project load), you are not taking any other hard classes like ENEE440, and if you really like networking, though you can definitely learn this better in your own free time with a couple of Github repos and articles.\r\n\r\nI would give this class 2 stars, but simply because of how rude and arrogant of a person Bobby is, I have to give it the 1 star.
