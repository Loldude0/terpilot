She gave us a 50% on format when the format was copied and pasted from an example project that she gave us. \n\r\nOverall, the worst teacher I've ever had in my life.

When you take this class and it says \"staff\" when you sign up and you realize on the first day that you have E. Blumner DROP IT IMMEDIATELY. TAKE IT AGAIN WITH SOMEONE ELSE (ANYONE ELSE). \n\r\nI am currently a junior at UMD and in all of the years of my schooling I have never encountered a more miserable teacher. Here is the breakdown of why: \n\r\nBlumner plays favorites and it is beyond apparent who her favorites. If you aren't one of her favorites, she absolutely despises you and makes sure that you are aware of it. I unfortunately upset her very early on in the year and have never (will never) recover from it. What upset her? The fact that after I finished my in class assignment, I worked on assignments for other classes. When she approached me about doing other work, I calmly asked her if she had any other work for me to do during the allotted class time. Her reply was a very snarky \"no\" and she marched away. From this point forward she went out of her way to make snide comments to me and about me to not only the TA but also other students in the class including \"well you aren't the worst writer in the class.\" \n\r\nAdditionally the amount of work that Blumner makes you complete for this class is insane. And once she marks you as one of her hated students, no matter how flawless the work you turn in, you will never receive the score you deserve. You will at best get a slightly better than average score. Her arbitrary point system of -.65 of a point for punctuation on your assignments diminishes your grade from an A to a B. The work she gives you is completely busy work and generally useless in terms of learning. She offers no actual insight into your writing but nitpicks specifics of your grammar or punctuation. \n\r\nAlso beware of her \"professionalism\" grade. She has an arbitrary point system for professionalism that includes (Direct quote) \" on-time, regular attendance; notification of absence in one or two cases all semester when class HAD to be missed; no other work but ours during classtime, including discussion board posts; phone usage; well done peer reviews; revision of projects and sending of surveys to clients.\" And when she determines that she doesn't like you, she gives you a 3/5 for professionalism because \"you have a negative attitude\" and should not be rewarded for that. A student in my class actually sent her an email calling her \"a completely incompetent person\" and still received a 4.5/5 on professionalism because he was on her \"hated students list.\" \n\r\nAlso: She does not follow the syllabus, she adds in extra assignments, and she makes you do discussion posts. These discussion posts (generally 3-4 per week) are the most USELESS waste of your time possible and they are completed for a grade. You even have to respond to 1-2 of your peers discussion posts which is even more irritating and pointless. Less than 1/2 of my class currently completes these worthless discussions. \n\r\nAnd finally. Just to give you an idea of how awful she truly is: The first day of classes we began with 23 students. 5 people dropped immediately. Since that point 6 students have WITHDRAWN from the course, one student with less than four weeks until the end of the semester. The fact that this woman drove away nearly half of her class is a very telling of her teaching ability. \n\r\nSUMMARY: \r\n-Miserable teacher who doesn't teach you anything.\r\n-Holds grudges against students. \r\n-Plays favorites and absolutely torments those who are not her favorites.\r\n-Arbitrary grading system \r\n-Grades work of students who are not her favorites EXTREMELY hard\r\n-Assigns BUSY WORK ALL THE TIME\r\n-Incredibly large work load. \r\nBonus: \r\n-Horrible speaking voice (nails on a chalkboard is a sweet symphony compared to her voice).

Yes, I know this is a big statement, but I wholeheartedly believe it is deserved. She made attending this class and doing the subsequent work absolutely miserable. \n\r\nAs a professor, one of your goals is to instill knowledge and actually teach your students. Professor Blumner did not even come close to accomplishing either of these objectives. She would not \u201cteach\u201d anything, as all of the material that was learned came from other students making chapter presentations to the rest of the class. When presented with most questions, her response would be \u201cgo look at the textbook.\u201d Oftentimes, the textbook disagreed with what she wanted anyways, thus reducing your grade. \n\r\nIn addition, much of the work we complete is tedious busy work. That is ironic because she stated at the first class that she prided herself on not assigning any busywork. However her way around this minor detail was to assign most every assignment we handed in, a value. This led to a few worth 1% or 2% of the final grade, or them being looped into her wide-arching \u201cprofessionalism\u201d grade. A prime example of this is the in AIDA class writing assignment that took many students an hour or so after class to complete. This was graded on a credit/no credit basis, worth 1% of the final grade. On top of this, she offered zero feedback on the grades, and the only thing students saw was the grade on ELMS. Unfortunately, many of those assignments took hours to complete. \n\r\nThe sad thing is that this class had the potential to be very useful, if taught correctly (or at least, any bit better than Professor Blumner displayed). I know that I will have to write many business propositions and memos and other professional documents as I enter and thrive in the corporate world. Sadly, this course did not help prepare me to do this. She would flip-flop on her own ideas of how to do something; sometimes she would tell us to consult the textbook, while other times instructing us the book was wrong. Mind you, this would be for the same assignment/part of an assignment. \n\r\nThat covers much of the academic area of Professor Blumner. Lets move on to an area that she could possibly be worse in: her behavior.\n\r\nPlaying favorites is something that should be avoided as much as possible, especially in a school or University setting. It is not fair to the students are \u201cfavorites\u201d, and much less fair to the ones that draw the ire of their instructors. Evidently Professor Blumner was never made aware of this. \n\r\nFrom day 1 of the class, it was apparent who she liked and who she did not. I was fortunate to be one of the ones who did not irk her. However, some of my classmates were not as lucky. For the entire semester, she would offer snide comments and pick on them. While I have no proof, myself and other students strongly believe that she graded the students she did not like much harder than the ones that she did. That is simply not fair, as students should be graded on the quality of their work, not whether they are loved or loathed by the professor. \n\r\nOn top of that, she used very elementary methods of getting our attention. If she had the smallest thing to say, Professor Blumner would incessantly clap her hands until we all were paying attention. While this was an effective method because all of the students just wanted the obnoxious noise to come to a halt, there has to be a better method of doing so. And we were by no means an obnoxious or unruly class. \n\r\nHer voice, while certainly out of her control, did nothing to contribute to the learning of the class. It was almost impossible to understand her, thanks to the scratchiness and low volume of her voice. In addition, she would often cut herself off mid sentence and say, \u201cyou know what I mean. \u201d Unfortunately, we rarely knew what she meant, and she was not making any effort to clarify things. I know you shouldn\u2019t be prevented from doing something by something natural, like your voice, but there has to be some type of way around this. It really pained me to listen to her speak. \n\r\nI contemplated dropping this class very early in the semester, but we were assigned a partner and assigned a semester long consulting project. I did not want to disappoint my partner, and make him take on the gargantuan task by himself, so I decided to stick it out. In hindsight, that was one of the worst decisions I have made, academics-wise in all of my life. I should have convinced him to drop with me and take it next semester taught by a professor that was capable and not miserable.\n\r\nAs you can probably tell by now, I had a horrible experience with this class, and more importantly, the professor. One of the very few positives that I can draw from this is that I am happy her name is not associated with the business school. I feel like she is a serious detriment to the university as a whole. The fact that I am paying tens of thousands of dollars to attend this fine institution, and this is the quality of instruction I receive; well I find that to be completely unacceptable. \n", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "B", "created": "2012-05-17T23:24:00Z"}, {"professor": "Ellen Blumner", "course": "ENGL394", "review": "Blumner may go down as one of the worst teachers the university has ever had. If Blumner does not like you on the first day of class your grade will be affected tremendously.  She plays favorites, and holds grudges for the entire semester.  Additionally, it is not that she simply holds grudges, she will attempt to make your life miserable and call you out in every class and grade you harder than other students in the class.  She has no problem sounding like a bitter/grumpy old lady.  \n\r\nIn terms of the actual class, everything is completely useless and tedious.  She believes that assignments are not busy work if she attaches a grade to them, so she will simply make assignments worth 1% of your overall grade that will take you hours to complete.  On top of that she does not follow her syllabus at all, and will change her guidelines and expectations on a person to person basis and will never clearly state what she wants.  Your grade will essentially come down to how much she likes you (and you will realize she likes NO ONE!)\n\r\nAdditionally, Blumner never really taught any classes.  For class, she would have groups of students present chapters from the textbook. Beyond that, she would instruct us to do meaningless book exercises, and then offer little feedback on the correctness of our answers. If you asked her a technical question, her response, more often than not was \u201cconsult the textbook.\u201d Beyond that, she had one of her TA\u2019s present a chapter lesson. I can hardly recall learning something of value from her. \n\r\nLastly, another point that I would like to touch on is the voice of the professor.  Now, i know this is nothing that she can control, but when teaching a class to numerous students throughout the day it really is important that the professor can speak.  Her voice might possibly be one of the most irritating sounds you will ever hear.  And i know many students can attest to this fact that it was indeed painful to listen to and became quite the distraction.\n\r\nIn conclusion, Do NOT TAKE HER CLASS or consider yourself warned!!", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2012-05-12T03:27:00Z"}, {"professor": "Ellen Blumner", "course": "ENGL394", "review": "Blumner is easily the worst teacher I have ever come across at this school.

She refused to acknowledge her mistakes and ended up giving me a 50% on an assignment that she deleted from my ELMS folder because after I uploaded it again it was past the due date.\n\r\nThe professor would consistently rip on her other sections.  I had a friend in the class before mine, and he would always tell how she hated my class.  At one point she even told our entire class that we were all lazy.

She is very grumpy and takes every assignment very personally. She holds grudges about everything, especially if you miss a class (although I never did, I saw her do it to many other students). If you say something to her that she doesn't like, she gets very angry and can be outright mean. She called out or yelled at several students right in the middle of class in front of everyone.\n\r\nIf she decides she does not like you (which I think was more than half of the class by the time the class was over) she will never be nice to you again. She grades very unfairly. I actually heard her say to a student: \"I can't believe what your GPA is here at the University, I am going to make sure that is changed by the end of this course.\"\n\r\nThe other major problem was that she gave us a class syllabus, than basically did the exact opposite of anything the syllabus said. Every assignment was changed or completely unclear. She would say one way to do it in class, than post another way to do it online, than say to refer to the book, which was never the way she actually wanted us to do it. Than, when we got to class she would be in another one of her moods and would decide to throw in another part that essentially no one did, than proceed to mark down everyone else for not doing it, using the justification that one or two students did it as proof that we all should have known it was necessary. \n\r\nAlso, syllabus due dates were ALWAYS changed. I don't think a single one was the same as the syllabus said.

I almost never ask for extensions, but this semester I had a particularly tough workload and needed to move my schedule around fairly often. The instructor was both gracious and generous with extensions.\r\n- The extra credit offered in this course is extensive. It gives students a little more comfort about their grades, while still making them put in some work to gain that credit.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\nThe assignment descriptions, the resources offered to students, and the instructor's feedback/grading left a great deal to be desired.\r\n- The assignment description were usually many paragraphs of muddled suggestions about what that a given assignment's theoretical purpose was. The fact that I had to reread the descriptions 4+ times for each assignment just to figure out where to start is an indication that it was poorly written/organized. I spoke with other students in the course about this, and they also commented on how confusing, long, and poorly structured each assignment's instructions were. Since this is an English course, I was very disappointed to see that the instructor was not held to the same standard as students when it came to clear, concise writing.\r\n- The resources offered were typically just articles or websites that had even more theoretical descriptions of the given assignment. Oftentimes, all a student needs is A) examples of completed works and B) a template. There were a few examples of completed works for larger assignments, which I greatly appreciated. Templates were few and far between, unfortunately.\r\nMultiple times, the instructor added this suggestion on the assignment description: \"There are some templates available in Word that you can use.\" This was confusing, because Word has hundreds of templates, most of them very different from each other. I want to be able to focus the quality of my writing, NOT whether I have the correct template. Another way of saying this: this course made the wrong tasks difficult. I would have loved to see one, simple template/outline available for each assignment.\r\n- The instructor's feedback was sometimes baffling. She would leave comments that made very little sense; I was genuinely confused by the meaning sometimes. I don't mean that I disagreed with her feedback, I mean that I sometimes had to ignore her suggestions (or take a guess at what she meant), because the comments she left could be interpreted in multiple ways. It is understandable that there is a lot of content coming in that she must grade, and it is probably hard for her to keep up, but I wish she had taken a few extra minutes to make sure that the feedback was more clearly actionable.\r\nE.g. \"Add more sources here, to support concept X\" or \"Add more research-backed arguments in this section, similar to what you had in section Y\", etc.\r\nIt is important for the instructor to provide feedback on the ideas and overall feel of each paper, yes, but if her advice is going to be broad then it should be much clearer than it was for most of my assignments.\r\n- The instructor's grading was a little questionable. The range for most assignments was roughly 85%-95%, with very little deviation from assignment to assignment. That tells me that this instructor was mostly grading based on the grade range she wanted the course to have, and she was not necessarily giving grades based on what a student actually deserved.
