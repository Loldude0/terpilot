He is one of the best, most receptive, caring and professional teachers out there. \r\nHe's a very fair grader, really cares about his students and goes the extra mile.

It's probably the best version of junior English available.\n\r\nIt's a class for all majors, but I seriously found it useful, even as a science major. Forrester makes it super bearable, is one of the nicest teachers I've had at UMD, and has a sense of humor. Loved taking this class. The only regret I had is that all of the writing assignments coincided with my exam days (just my luck) - but one time he even pushed back a due date to Wednesday because several people in my bio class had an exam that Monday. SUCHHH a nice guy.\n\r\nHe's kind of picky/particular, but he gives a ton of helpful feedback. And as long as you fix exactly what he tells you to, he gives you an A on rewrites.\n\r\nYou have to put in work, but it really wasn't too bad. I never went to office hours or spent too long on papers (whoops) and still got B+'s and A's on my papers. A's on papers are hard to get, but A's in the class are handed out generously, so don't be discouraged if you get like a B on 3 papers or something - DO THE REWRITES THOUGH.\n\r\nAnyway, Mark is literally the man.

I learned so much from this class, and I'm so glad I took it with him. \n\r\nThe class isn't easy, but you will learn so much if you actually put in the work and try to do well on the papers.  Take advantage of the rewrites, and DEFINITELY go to his office hours.  I think that's the main reason I got an A, is because I went to his office hours repeatedly for help, and to ask questions on how I could improve.  \n\r\nHe's a funny guy, and class discussion are engaging.  I would definitely recommend taking professional writing with him.

Take the H-version and knock it out; it's not a complete cake-walk, but it's not too hard.\n\r\nForrester is a great teacher who takes time to connect with his students, and is always available for extra help.

Advanced Comp is a pain, but he made it bearable. He's a very kind man who genuinely wants his students to learn, and will help students in any way he can. I'm SO glad I took the honors version of this class-i can't imagine it was harder than the regular version, and since it's such a group-based course, having other honors kids was clutch.
