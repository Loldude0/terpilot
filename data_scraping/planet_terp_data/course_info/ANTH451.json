The class is easy, and you will learn a lot. The professor is often disorganized regarding homework assignments and responding to emails, however he grades so leniently that it doesn't really matter. The professor is a supreme expert in environmental archeology, and you will learn a lot about environmental archeology in this class. The only thing to worry about is the final paper, which was a large undertaking. But, the professor will help you as much as you need for it (suggestions on where to start, doing some research for you, \"feedback at any stage\") and he graded it pretty leniently. I'd recommend this teacher, and I'd recommend this class.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-12-28T05:26:32.708052Z"}], "department": "ANTH", "course_number": "451", "name": "ANTH451", "title": "Environmental Archaeology", "credits": 3, "description": "<b>Credit only granted for:</b> ANTH451, ANTH651, ANTH448F, ANTH668F.\n<b>Formerly:</b> ANTH448F.\nAn overview of modern environmental archaeology as a tool for the interdisciplinary investigation of past and present global change and to engage the long term past with current issues of sustainability and rapid environmental change.", "is_recent": true, "geneds": null}
