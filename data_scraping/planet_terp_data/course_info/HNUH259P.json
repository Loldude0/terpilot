Are you a doodler? These pastimes are more than a distraction and amusement. Sketching is a way of thinking about your environment and understanding how you inhabit space. This course invites students to experience Washington, D.C. like an architect: with their eyes and their hands. We will study the work of architects and urban designers; visit landmarks in and around D.C. and the campus; and sketch indoors and outdoors. With D.C. as our laboratory, we will draw to understand the components that make the city a city, and explore tactile meanings of buildings and public spaces. Techniques presented in the course will range from the technical to the artistic, from field measuring and freehand sketching to creating 2D and 3D architectural drawings and presenting them. No drawing experience required! This course is self-contained but paired with HNUH259T in the Drawn to D.C. track, which explores the spaces we create and inhabit, and how they inhabit us.", "is_recent": true, "geneds": null}
