Most of the exam problems look just like the ones on the practice midterms but expect a few curveballs.\r\n\r\nAs an instructor, Clyde is objectively frustrating to follow. He'll take examples from the slides and change them so that if you don't pay close attention the whole time, you may end up lost. \r\n\r\nAsking questions in class is good. He won't demoralize you if you have the balls to ask a question, but if you try and answer a question that HE asks, and you get it even slightly wrong, he will not be forgiving. Just before Thanksgiving, he taught a lecture that was like an intro to algorithms, and there were only 15 of us in class that day (weather was bad and it was the day before break). I guessed the answer to one of his problems, and upon learning that I got it wrong, he followed it up with \"I guess you really don't know anything.\" It's objectively a terrible teaching tactic, but the TA's will be a lot more helpful in giving constructive feedback during discussions or office hours.\r\n\r\nMy tips for surviving the Clyde:\r\n\r\n1. I definitely wouldn't have survived without this. Go to discussion. The TA's will go over problems more in-depth than he does and will answer your questions without ridicule. I personally never went to office hours but if that's your thing hey more power to you.\r\n2. Do problems from the textbook to prepare for exams. I got a 78 on the first midterm when I didn't do this, and then a 98 on the second when I cracked open the book.\r\n3. Look back at the homework to get an idea of the types of questions that can come up on exams. Oftentimes, midterm problems will be carbon copies of these with a few words or numbers changed.\r\n4. Follow along during lecture on a laptop with the lecture slides. I found it helpful to get some notes a minute or two in advance of him covering it. Side note - Jason makes the slides and Clyde lectures on it, so that's why it seems like he's only reading it for the first time. Also, Clyde will sometimes skip over a lot of slides at once because he feels it's not important, but it can be helpful to get a couple more examples under your belt while he's rambling.\r\n5. Try to keep your cool. Clyde is so frustrating, I can't stress this enough, but if you're taking his class, the best you can do is get your bearings and learn more in-depth on your own time (which honestly can be during lecture).\r\n\r\nI hated his class, but I'm taking 351 next semester with him because I'm a freshman and register last so wish me luck.", "rating": 2, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2018-12-13T01:55:47Z"}, {"professor": "Jason Filippou", "course": "CMSC250", "review": "Jason is disorganized and disrespectful.

The concepts were simple, and the exam was easy (avg 90%).  I don't know if this was the best thing, as it may signal some to stop taking the class seriously (I know I did, which was a terrible decision).\r\n\r\nI don't know how I feel about the second section of the course.  This was set theory and proofs.  The lectures were effective in learning the material, but I feel like we could have gotten more practice beyond what was on the homeworks to really solidify the material.  For example, my thick skull didn't realize you could prove the two sides of a biconditional using different methods, so on the exam I tried proving both halves directly.  The homeworks given weren't enough to solidify the material in my brain.\r\n\r\nMy big issues with the course are in the third section.  I felt woefully unprepared for some of the content in this section.  Sums, products, and induction were fine (although it wasn't so cool that the sum formulas weren't provided on the final).  It's combinatorics where the major issues start to arise for me.  The range of combinatorics problems is much broader than anything else in the course, and I feel that Justin didn't prepare us very well on that front both in lecture examples and homework.  Admittedly, I don't understand the subject very well at all.  Regardless, after going through the homeworks, reading the solutions, and going through the final practice problems he posted towards the end, I just didn't feel prepared for what may have come on the final.  It felt like too little practice given how much there is to it.  I found probability a bit easier, but the problem remained that there was not as much practice as I would have liked on it.  Bayes Theorem is free though, granted I memorize the formula.  I don't feel that needed more.\r\n\r\nThe weekly groupworks should have been a potential remedy for this.  Unfortunately, they're not.

His lectures are very casual and are usually decent, albeit they do have mistakes in them quite often which he does catch in class. Not a huge detriment but it does make it slightly annoying. He records all his lectures as well which is again, very helpful. \r\n\r\nKline also is one of the profs who does not weigh tests heavily as part of your 250 grades. Your quizzes and homework can be a huge grade booster in that regard which can be helpful.\r\nHis exams are also noticeably on the easier side I feel. The grade averages for my semester were around ~90%+ for Exam 1 (INSANE!) ~80% for Exam 2 and 3, and the final (with the final being slightly lower than 80% in the high 70s)\r\n\r\nWhile these are good averages, they aren't crazy, but I'd imagine the majority of the class passes with a higher grade due to the homework and quiz having higher weights. Additionally, all the extra credit in the course probably adds up to 3%+ (There is extra credit on some tests which is hard, and homework extra credit which I will get to later)\r\n\r\nTHE BAD:\r\nOh boy, where to begin? Kline is virtually nonexistent outside of lectures. He outsources everything to the TAs. They make the homework, the quizzes, answer all the Piazza posts, grade everything. This can lead to some issues.\r\n\r\nThe \"Style-Guide\" is a style reference that we are supposed to use when doing all our homework and quizzes. Unfortunately, because this is a TA resource, at times it is disconnected from what Kline teaches. On more than one occasion (INCLUDING AN EXAM!!!) the style that Kline wished us to use did not match the style guide from the TAs. While this usually ends up not harming your grade directly, it can make the questions much more confusing and unnecessarily hard.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, due to this disconnect, there are SO MANY occasions where quiz or homework questions are flat out DROPPED because they either had style mismatches or other issues that made them not be graded and gave everyone a 100% for them. One quiz we took had 3 questions, and 2/3 were dropped. While this is good for the student as they get free points, it is highly annoying and clearly a sign of a disorganized class. It can also feel discouraging to put in effort on homework only for it to not matter once the question is dropped.\r\n\r\nNow onto the major point of contention: THE HOMEWORKS\r\nThe TAs write all the homework and they subscribe to the policy of \"Hard Homework\" preps you for the exam. And by Hard I mean that the homework are a MAGNITUDE harder and can get downright crazy. The infamous HW4 had an average completion time of over 10 hours for the majority of the course. Some homework got to 14 pages long. It's bad. The TAs eventually chilled near the end of the semester after all the complaints, so perhaps my dear future terp you will have it easier. Just be warned though, it can get bad! OH or internet searching on proofwiki and other things is downright required sometimes for some of the more insane proofs.\r\n\r\nTo compensate there is a flat 8% bonus extra credit if you use LaTex for your homework. This adds up to about 2.5% extra credit for your entire course grade which is very nice and the sole saving grace of turning your homework averages high. \r\n\r\n\r\nTl;DR\r\nTHE SUMMARY:\r\nKline is a decent prof who outsources his work to the TAs. It is easy to get a good grade in this class due to easy exams and frequent extra credit, but the workload for this class can be high due to difficult homework. If you are ok with spending a lot of time in this course but an easier course grade-wise, take Kline.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "B", "created": "2023-05-26T05:32:45.242011Z"}, {"professor": "Justin Wyss-Gallifent", "course": "CMSC250", "review": "He makes the class easy and the exams are straightforward enough where you can do well as long as you review lecture notes and homeworks (I actually found these homeworks much more difficult than the exams).

(they're still helpful though so give em a look)\r\n- The moment you find yourself struggling with a question on your HW, ask a TA during OH or discussion.

Throughout the semester lectures were disorganized (got a little bit better towards the end, but still weren't great), and he would sometimes leave gaps in the steps of a problem/not do some problems since they were \"too annoying\" (but we would have to know how to do them). This semester, the class weights were 40% homework, 10% lab worksheets, 30% midterms (2 midterms), and 20% final. The homework problems were difficult, but you were able to get most done on your own (you have at least a week to do each of them) and if you had any questions about any of the problems you could go to office hours and the TAs would help you understand them better. The worksheets were every Wednesday and they were done in discussion (some TAs would go over how to do the problems, but mine didn't) and they were graded on completion. The midterms were fine for the most part, but on both midterms, there was a problem where very few people got them completely right (e.g only 5-10% of people got full credit for them) so your exam grade basically dropped a letter grade just from that one problem (on the first midterm that problem ended up getting dropped, but it was a special circumstance). Max also taught using Justin's notes (so you could have chosen to not attend lectures). \r\n\r\nI feel like the class would have been a lot better if Max learned the material ahead of time and planned the course in a way that would work for him (instead of using Justin's notes, there are pros and cons to not using Justin's notes though). I felt like he was learning the material/what he was teaching the day of or the night before the lecture because he often made mistakes when explaining/doing the problems in the lecture. I also felt like the class was being run by the TAs and Max (and this isn't necessarily a bad thing), but it felt like the TAs would tell him often what to do and what not to do.\r\n\r\nI was going to give Max a higher rating, but the following reasons are why I didn't. The final was more challenging than the midterms and I would almost go as far as saying that some of the problems on the final were as hard as the homework problems. I also felt like there was a problem on the final that was just straight-up, not possible (maybe it's a skill issue, but it didn't seem possible to do based on what the question was asking). This leads me to another issue that I have with the class. Almost all homework assignments/review sheets that we had in the class had typos which is frustrating (since some problems are either impossible/completely different even with a slight change in wording). I will say that most typos were noticed and fixed quickly, but I don't think it should happen that often (this is a red flag for me because if typos happen that often are they reading/doing the problems beforehand?).\r\n\r\nMax is a 10/10 person, but a 3/10 teacher in my opinion.", "rating": 2, "expected_grade": "A-", "created": "2023-12-16T01:24:29.071328Z"}, {"professor": "Paul Kline", "course": "CMSC250", "review": "So, as many other reviews have accurately depicted, this professor is extremely disorganized and hard to work with in a sense.

What's so funny to me is that Elias is the one that specifically makes the HWs and sometimes the professor and most of the time, other TAs will get confused from the question and not know how to properly solve a question. Besides that, I'd say Paul himself is a good lecturer but I feel like he needs to take better initiative and not mention in class half the time that \"it makes grading easier for the TAs.\" That is one thing I hated the most, which was saying that statement, and sometimes he'd say it so often that we'd laugh in class because of how often it was mentioned. On top of this, as others have stated, the quizzes are truly easy as it is open-note, and the HWs, despite their difficulty, can be easy if you have a group and split the problems among yourselves. With the exams, I'd say Exam 1 was the easiest, by far, Exam 2 was relatively difficult because it has proofs with T/F questions that can easily trip you up with properties regarding surjectivity, injectivity, etc... and Exam 3, was a step in the right direction in terms of difficulty, which I'd say was a more fair exam.

If you have a problem/situation, he's more than willing to accommodate you. If you have a question, he'll go for hours 1 on 1 with you in office hours until you understand it. \r\n- Lectures were clear, cogent, and recorded (slides were posted too). Idk what other ppl are talking abt when it comes to his lecturing; he has genuine passion for the subject and that comes to life in his lecturing. Lectures are problem-oriented: he'll start with a problem and walk through the thought process for how to solve it, which is really useful come exam time.\r\n- Speaking of exams: everybody here is completely capping. Paul's exams were EZ: Exam 1: 89 median, Exam 2: 75 median, Exam 3: 94 median, Final: 84. Yes, exam 2 was a little tough, but the other exams more than made up for it. \r\n- The homework point is the one I really don't understand. The homeworks are substantial, and usually harder than the exams (which means you can walk into the exams and kill it bc you've literally done harder stuff). Tbh, not one took me more than 4-5 hours and I got either 97s or 100s on them. Most were a 2-3 hour job. If you go to office hours (shout-out to Rushil!!!) you'll be totally fine on them. (And in case you think I'm some kind of math genius, I am not. Calc II was hard; def harder than this). \r\n- Quizzes are literally free 100s. They'll just be repurposed lecture problems, and you have 2 hours to do it + its open internet. So all you have to do is pull up Paul's slides and you're good to go. \r\nCONS:\r\n- Grading. It's slow (kinda understandable given that there are 300+ students and it's a proof based course, but still) and the grading TAs can vary wildly. Some have absolutely no chill, so make sure to format your quantifiers and proof goals correctly bc they'll rip you to shreds over the small stuff. \r\n- Poorly worded questions: Towards the end of the semester, homeworks and quizzes starting being hosted on ELMS (I assume for the autograding since they were behind, see prev point). The problem was, they kept entering in the wrong answers or the wrong questions. I remember one problem asked about straights (in poker), but you had to somehow assume they meant straight flushes (very different answer!!). This happened to some extent earlier in the semester (homework questions were changed/reworded), but it got really bad at the end.\r\n- Some flip-flopping in discussion formats. It started being a mini-lecture, then it was a problem-solving sec, then it was checking other ppls proofs, then it was back to problem-solving but this time you could get extra credit. I mean, the extra credit was nice, but it was still kinda hectic finding out what we'd be doing in discussion via a canvas announcement the day of. \r\n\r\nI would normally give him 4-4.5 stars for the organization issues, but since he's getting dragged unfairly by these reviews, I'll give him a 5.

However, that turned out to be a fat lie.\r\n\r\nLectures:\r\nStarting with lectures, he speaks too quickly, often skipping essential steps in a lesson and assuming students will understand or skipping because it's too much to explain for this lecture, and he does not feel like going in-depth. Even though he records them, these recordings are often released days after lectures. At times, students had to ask for them since he did not upload them promptly. Personally, after the first exam, I stopped regularly attending lectures and only came to talk with friends or because I had nothing else to do. Attending, other than for exams, was a huge waste of time if I was not going to get anything from it. His lecture style also focused on engaging only the front row of students, and there was always a correction or mistake made in his lecture slides, which was confusing in terms of formatting work.\r\n\r\nHomework:\r\nThe homework is probably the most difficult and time-consuming assignment in this class. Although it prepares you for the exams, the amount is ridiculous, considering we have other classes and work to balance alongside the homework. Moreover, they were weekly assignments, so most of your week was spent trying to figure out what the homework was even asking for. I feel as though there were also a lot of mistakes in the homework at times, and you would likely have to go to office hours to understand some problems since they often included extended problems we may not have talked about in class.\r\n\r\nExams/Quizzes:\r\nThe quizzes were not too bad. I would just say that at the beginning of the semester, we had quizzes on topics we had not gone in-depth into in the lecture or homework, which meant unless you did all the homework initially, the quiz might have been slightly more difficult. Overall, the exams were not too bad either as long as you understood the homework, quizzes, and discussion worksheets. The only thing that I disliked about the exams was how heavy they were with content, having multiple sections of multiple choice and more sections of free response. For the second exam, there were a lot of sections of questions and content, and not enough time to answer them, which led to the average being the lowest in the class because most people did not finish. Something else I found frustrating was the number of corrections made during the exams. You would think they have all this time to make the exam and go through them for any mistakes, but for every exam and even in the final, there was always some sort of correction to be made, which was very annoying in my opinion. Sometimes, they did not even announce the correction out loud; they just wrote it on the board and assumed you would look up.\r\n\r\nFinal Review:\r\nThe TAs in this class were never on the same page regarding what they were looking for when it came to assignments, so it was very disorganized.
