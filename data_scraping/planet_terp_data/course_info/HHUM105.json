This was his first semester as a part of Hohum, and I think he did a great job. Hhum105 can be a lot of work, but none of it is particularly difficult. Dr. Ontiveros actually restructured the course partway through the semester to make it easier on us, and occasionally would cancel/postpone readings or assignments to lessen our work load. The only downside to this class was the reading. The main textbook  is very dense and drags on a lot. There are also many supplemental readings throughout the semester, but as long as you just push through them you're good. Other than that, hhum105 was a lot of fun, and people were always willing to participate and discuss in class. There are a couple of smaller projects and then one big capstone at the end of the semester, which counts as the final, and they are only as hard as you make them.
