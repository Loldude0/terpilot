He is so raw and super interesting and clearly knowledgeable. The class is based on discussion posts and quizzes, one per topic. You have to go to class at least 6 times. Classes are discussion based since they are only once a week, so make sure you participate because if not it will be super awkward when no one talks. Also got to go on a field trip to the African American museum in DC for a private tour with the curator of the sport exhibits which was literally the highlight of my college learning. It was SO fun and interesting and an amazing opportunity! Could not recommend Mower more, for any class :)", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A-", "created": "2023-12-20T20:33:04.811889Z"}], "department": "KNES", "course_number": "485", "name": "KNES485", "title": "Sport and Globalization", "credits": 3, "description": "<b>Prerequisite:</b> Minimum grade of C- in KNES287.\n<b>Restriction:</b> Must be in a major within the SPHL-Kinesiology department; and must have earned a minimum of 75 credits.\nExamination of sport culture from a global perspective; focuses on theorizing the similarities and differences between various national sporting cultures.", "is_recent": true, "geneds": null}
