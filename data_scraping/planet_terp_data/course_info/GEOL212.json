He seriously shines and has an evident passion for the class that made it incredibly enjoyable. He prioritized our learning and comprehension of the material and has solidified himself as my favorite professor at UMD so far with his humor and genuine zest for life. Although homework can be a bit tedious, the class content is incredibly interesting, and I think that anyone with even a slight interest in the solar system or astronomy would greatly enjoy this course.
