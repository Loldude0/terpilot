Dr. Stocker got stuck teaching every single one of the 21 sections of chem 135 offered fall 2020. As a result, it was nearly impossible to get individual help from her or the TAs, leaving many students to turn (unsuccessfully) to GSS. Dr. Stocker also all but banned students from emailing her directly, which seems harsh at first, but after reading so many stupid questions in the groupmes from people who were just oblivious to the syllabus or her emails, seems fair. Also as a result of all the sections, Dr. Stocker released lectures MWF (even for people who signed up for TuTh sections, but it was pre recorded, so whatever), and the TAs moved their discussion times.\r\nTeaching style: The lectures themselves were pretty good. All were pre recorded and uploaded to panopto, and she tended to stick within the 50 minute time frame. They could be a bit boring at times, and a bit heavy on organic chemistry (she wants to be an orgo teacher, and it shows), but overall better than what you'd expect considering the rest of the class. The discussions were lowkey useless, and I started skipping pretty early on. Dr. Stocker also released practice sets for every topic. DO THEM!!!\r\nGrading: The chem department likes to give impossible tests and then a crazy curve, and Stocker is no exception. My 82% turned into an A. Unfortunately, info about the curve is very poorly communicated. She doesn't release estimates of final grade cutoffs. After each exam, she releases 2 sample grade cutoffs. One tells you an estimated letter grade of the exam you just took, based on points. These give students the illusion of hope, since exam grades tend to have means around 50-60%, but since only the overall grade is curved, these are functionally useless. The other set of grade cutoffs tells you your estimated letter grade in the class as of that exam. For some reason, she makes you manually add up points on just some assignments, instead of just using the percentages that elms auto generates. It's just annoying.\r\nExams: Since Stocker had 800 students, she couldn't manually grade exams. Instead, she used the quiz feature on elms to give exams that were all multiple choice/drop down/check all/etc. Anything that could auto grade. This meant you got your grade instantly, but there was no partial credit. All exams were on an insane time crunch designed to make the averages low. Exams were given at 7 PM EST, regardless of section, unless you had another class at that time. She didn't proctor the exams (too many students for zoom), which led to more creative (read: annoying) ways to catch cheating.\r\nThe cheating allegations: THIS IS WHAT BROKE THE CLASS!!! Exam 2 had 2 bait questions, where she gave a real chemical name, but changed the formula. This was designed to catch students googling answers. Unfortunately, a tiny mistake on the math and/or a miscount could get you the same answer as google. Every student who got the google answer was reported to OSC for cheating, and their cases were still being processed even after finals. All in all, 152 students got accused of cheating.

CHEM135 is supposed to be a nightmare for engineering majors and is often considered a \"weed-out course\" but after hearing things from friends who have Griffith and comparing her with Pacella, it is clear that Pacella is the way to go.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- There is an insane curve for this class. I did decently well on the first midterm (A) but FAILED the last two midterms (D & E). However, I have an A on my transcript for this class because an 80% was the cutoff for an A letter grade this semester.\r\n- Pacella does \"clicker questions\" through a website called Learning Catalytics and they are easy points to boost your grade. This does mean you have to go to lectures to know when the questions go live. You even get half credit for each question just for participating and submitting an answer. For example, if there were 4 Learning Catalytics questions in a given lecture and you happened to submit an answer for every question but they were all wrong, you would still get a 2/4 for that day. Pacella drops the lowest few Learning Catalytics sessions from your overall grade at the end of the semester. Also, since Pacella is such a nice person, he will frequently announce that a Learning Catalytics session will be fully participation points for some days (ex: after an exam date or after a confusing lecture)\r\n- The textbook is online and interactive through Pearson which is helpful. Do NOT fall behind on reading because Pacella will assign chapters to read but it is extremely easy to get away with not reading which becomes a horrible habit. You must purchase the textbook for this class because the online homework comes with the package.\r\n- There are weekly online homeworks based on the readings. Pacella drops the lowest to help your grade.\r\n- There are 3 midterms and one final. In the case that you do better on the final exam than you did on one of the midterms, your final exam score will replace your lowest midterm exam score. THIS. SAVED. ME.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Not necessarily a complaint regarding the professor but there is a whole crap ton of material for this class. The curriculum for this class is similar to the content covered in AP Chemistry from high school... Only about 5x as fast.\r\n- The midterms are HARD. I often found myself studying for over a week on these exams yet still receiving the scores that I mentioned previously. On the first midterm the class average was a B but that quickly dropped to a class average of a D on the second and third midterms. Our second midterm also had way too many questions to be able to do in 50 minutes. Pacella even sent out an email to the class to apologize for how lengthy it was. However, the curve for the class was adjusted to compensate for this.\r\n- Occasionally, it would be difficult to fully understand what Pacella was lecturing about. He is extremely knowledgable and it is possible that he forgets that he is lecturing to a class full of majority freshman students who are learning these concepts for the first time. This is a rare complaint though. Most of the time, his lectures are very informative.\r\n- It is pretty easy to pass the class and pull even an A. What would be an E (55%) in another class was considered passing and curved to a (C), based on the curve we were given. (This will most likely change based on how YOUR class performs on midterms). Because of this, I don't know how much I truly retained from this class.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think Pacella is the way to go for CHEM135.

It's pretty important to know some of the ions for the exams, so I suggest just writing them all on your notecard lol (you can also just memorize them if you're built different).

It\u2019s worth noting that the curve is just as insane as the averages, meaning that your average 55% grade will translate to roughly a B-.
