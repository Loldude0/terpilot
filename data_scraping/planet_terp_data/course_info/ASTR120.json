I had him for 120 and currently have him for 121 and thoroughly enjoyed both classes, even the parts about planets which I don\u2019t really care about. His lectures are really thorough so they\u2019re a must-attend, you don\u2019t get the same preparation from reading the textbook and slides like with some professors. I felt adequately prepared for all the tests from the lectures, homeworks, and practice exams he posts. He also does a retest after every midterm that is open-note and averages the grade between your test and retest if you did better on a retest question, so that it can only bring your grade up. That really helps you learn the material! He also does a bonus question on each homework and exam, so for awhile I had over 100% in both 120 and 121.
