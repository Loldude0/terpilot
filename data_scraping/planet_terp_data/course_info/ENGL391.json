She was my junior English professor this past semester (Fall 2014).  Worst professor I have had in my 3 years at the University of Maryland.  I have honestly not had a professor or TA who came close to being as terrible as she was.  \n\r\nDidn't know how to use ELMs at all, or any technology for that matter.  She forced us to use online technology that she didn't have a clue how to use, such as Microsoft OneDrive and an online web site creator.  \n\r\nIn regards to ELMs, She set up her ELMs in the most confusing, nonsensical way possible.  We couldn't even view our grades, which didn't make a difference anyway as she graded about 80% of our assignments on Christmas Eve, including assignments from September and October... DID NOT HAVE A SYLLABUS!  She had one at first, did not stick to it at all, and then ended up deleting it from ELMs because as she said, \"some students were going ahead and doing assignments before they were due\" or in other words, they were being good students....\n\r\nAs other reviewers have said, she was also very rude and sometimes would yell at us when we were confused with her directions.  She made the most random due dates, with an assignment due almost every Saturday, Tuesday, and Thursday.  Also made a research assignment to be due the day after Thanksgiving, saying that we have to talk to our relatives at Thanksgiving dinner to learn about their careers or something...after a few students complained she moved the due date ahead two days to the day before Thanksgiving.  I failed to mention that she would not release assignments until a day or a few days before they were due, for no reason at all.\n\r\nWhile I received an A in the class, her grading was extremely strange, and seemed to be subjectively given.  For example, she would write a decent number of  criticisms on assignments and then give an A on the paper, while another paper would have one or two grammar errors and receive a C...\n\r\nDefinitely agree with the person below who said she pries into students' personal lives.  Completely unprofessional, and would also make rude comments on students who weren't in class, especially on their personal lives.  She would also be very rude to her TA.  One class the TA got the attendance wrong and after she left Faith spent 5 minutes talking trash about her and how the University doesn't offer good TAs for English.  \n\r\nWhile I feel bad giving her 1 star while receiving an A in the class, she is without a doubt the worst professor I have ever had or even heard of at the University of Maryland.  There would be times when she would give ridiculous explanations or when she would yell at us, and the class would be shaking their heads and looking at each other incredulously.

I never went to his class after the first week and this dude is super chill about whether you go to his class or not, as long as you doing the homework, you will be fine, and he give generous grade. Workload is easy, I never struggled for his class. if you don't have time for the paper, trust me just write something and he will give a pretty good grade as long as you submit something.

This was a unique kind of professional writing course that was specifically held during the winter, where our writing assignments were based around the work of J. R. R. Tolkien. A good chunk of the workload was simply reading the Lord of the Rings, and our assigned writings were mostly creative assignments that were open-ended (no stressful research papers). Every assignment felt meaningful and relevant, and he was on top of responding to emails if we had questions about the assignments. We had a few zoom meetings where he enthusiastically talked about Tolkien's life and his writing, and where we also got a peak into a study abroad session in Oxford, U.K. I don't know if this course will be offered every year, but if it is being offered and you don't mind spending some extra money to knock out your professional writing requirement during the winter, I could not recommend it more. Even if you're not a book fan, you will definitely enjoy this course more than most other professional writing courses.
