He's a nice guy but disorganized and not good at communicating. Our syllabus wasn't published until the second week of class, and it became immediately inaccurate because he ignored assignments on the syllabus and added new ones with no notice. \r\nHe splits up the capstone paper into 4 benchmarks, but he will not give the due dates until a few weeks before. Do not ask for an extension because he will not grant one. He does not use rubrics for his class, so he takes off points, and you have to email him and ask why. Speaking of email, he is AWFUL at responding. Do not expect a response for at least 3 days if not a week.\r\nThe class is online which gives a lot of flexibility, and we have never gone the full 2.5 hours which is really nice. He also does not give filler assignments or busywork aside from a few quick and easy assignments in the first few weeks. \r\n\r\nAgain, he's not completely awful, and I don't think he intends to be difficult, but he has a separate 9-5 job, and you can tell that job is his priority, not this class.", "rating": 2, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-04-03T20:34:28.987647Z"}, {"professor": "Maushami DeSoto", "course": "PHSC497", "review": "AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
