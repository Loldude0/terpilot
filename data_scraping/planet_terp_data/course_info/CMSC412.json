He does have a little bit of a speech impediment, but it didn't hinder his communication of the material to me in any way. We are all human right? Too many students used the excuse that they couldn't do a project because it wasn't heavily discussed in lecture, but not once have I had a CS course that went into detail about a project, not even 131! It may have been the fact that I was very well prepared for the course because of ENEE350. Shankar is very approachable, in his office or in class, much more so then most professors. He also spent the last class taking suggestions from students about how he can revise the course to better teach his students for the next time he is teaching it. How often do you see that? This guy actually wants his students to learn, and isn't out to make your life a living hell. His exams can be tedious, but they are definitely curved. He is a very fair grader, though you may find that your TAs are not so much. All in all the project is very time consuming, and is worth about 50% of your grade. The project though is not curved!

His teaching style takes getting used to; he basically walks into class everyday, opens up VI and just types notes, which you are expected to copy down and know. If you take notes on paper, learn to do it by computer, or you will get crazy pissed when he hops all over the place modifying what he wrote. My personal suggestion is Microsoft OneNote. Of course, he posts the notes file online, so you don't really need to take notes, but I would advise you do so, particularly if you're not that familiar with the subject.\n\r\nHe involves the class by basically asking us questions and writing the answers in his VI file. He writes it very colloquially which is nice, but sometimes he uses really obnoxiously large, outmoded words (draconian, pathological etc.).\n\r\nThe way the lectures go will be entirely up to you and your classmates. In my case, my classmates were total geniuses. We have 1 guy who got a diploma from MIT, half the robotics team, and a bunch of other people who basically know everything there is to know about linux.\n\r\nThese people will be the bane of your existence if you are not one of them. They will side track the class, ask really convoluted and (in my opinion) irrelevant questions, and basically confuse the HELL out of you.\n\r\nIt is basically your job to slow these people down and make sure they don't get too many opportunities to derail the class.\n\r\nNeil also gives quizzes if someone's cell phone goes off in the class. So, study your notes every night basically. He also has a huge vocab sheet he posts at the beginning of the semester, with words that will be covered on his multiple choice exams.\n\r\nNow some of you may have seen me say multiple choice, and grinned happily; set aside that notion, Neil's exams are pretty damn bad. His questions are more tricks than tests of knowledge, there are several that can be interpreted to mean different things, and it's really anyone's guess as to what they truly ask. Other questions can sometimes reword the answers in such a way that even if you know what the answer is, finding them among the choices is tricky.\n\r\nThe projects in this course are pure hell for the most part with 1 or 2 exceptions. This isn't really Neil's fault, he delegated it all to his TA, who mismanaged time a fair amount (routinely showed lecture slides for projects 3 weeks before they were ASSIGNED).\n\r\nOverall, it's not easy to review this course, as I don't know if it's me, the TA, the professor, or the course itself that's the problem, but I do put in 40 ish hours a week for out of class work, and I have a C-.\n\r\nNeil is a fair guy though, so I am not too worried about failing/passing.\n\r\nIf you want an A in this class, and haven't been weaned on linux, then you will need to start reading the book weeks before the semester begins. Make sure you have flashcards ready from a previous semester on DAY ONE of the class.\n\r\nLook over previous semester's projects.\n\r\nThis class is more demanding than any other I have ever taken, and it's in no small part because of the disparity in intelligence of the individuals who take it.\n\r\nIt's going to be a tough, long, hard semester, but keep your head up, and prepare well, and you will get the grade you earn.

This is both the hardest and worst course that I've ever had the displeasure of taking at UMD. I enrolled in this class because I thought that Operating Systems is a fundamental and useful skill to learn, even if difficult, but found out that the administration of this class makes this 10x more harder for literally no reason. There are so many things wrong with this course that I wouldn't recommend ANYONE taking it because it's not worth it. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, others seemed to like the professor's lecturing ability, but I did not. He goes on tangents all the time and is very unclear in his statements that it is impossible to focus. The slides are comprehensive, but are taken straight from the textbook so that isn't really a credit to the professor.\r\n\r\nThe projects and exams though, that is a different hell. Let's talk projects. Each one is incredibly difficult, and the instructions are HORRIBLE. There is really no valid reason why there should be a spec, slides, and FAQ for EVERY SINGLE PROJECT. The spec is awfully written and flat out wrong about things, the project slides are vague and also have incorrect information. The FAQs don't answer certain questions with any new information, and the fact that an FAQ is even needed for a project means that the instructions are poorly written. And to make things worse, even the spec, slides, and FAQ are sometimes not enough. \r\n\r\nOn a related note, administration for this course was TRULY TERRIBLE. Questions on Piazza were just left unanswered even though there were many people with the same question; the TAs just didn't answer and weren't active. I'm pretty sure they were also left in the dark about logistics in the class, because it was near the end of the semester and we STILL did not have breakdowns of grading. That part of the course website was just never filled out. And one of our pop quizzes, which we only had 10 minutes to do and had a very poor average, was worth almost an entire project grade. That is completely ridiculous and shows how little the professor cares about administration for this class. For exams, we didn't get any review material, no study guide or previous exams, zip, zilch, nada. Just \"look at the slides\" which are hundreds if not thousands of slides so it's impossible to study everything on it. In addition, for our final, the professor was very unaccommodating to concerns over the Omicron variant, and refused to move the final online despite multiple CS classes shifting online, and almost the entire class requesting this change. No reasoning was given, of course. \r\n\r\nLastly, our final exam, which is worth a quarter of our final grade, was put on the grade server, and we never even got it back to see what we got wrong, let alone a regrade request. It was simply put on Testudo. This fact may change since this review is posted, but nevertheless it is inexcusable to have these final grades submitted without students seeing the reason, especially when this resource is easily available via Gradescope. \r\n\r\nI get that Operating Systems is a hard concept, but like I said, the administration made this course needlessly more difficult. I am sure that most other people in the class agree with me regarding the majority of the points that I raised here, and there are probably more points that I didn't mention. These points are definitely fixable (having clear grading, clear project descriptions, enforcing Piazza answering, giving us study material) and should definitely be addressed the next time this course is taken. I find that unlikely to happen though, so I do not recommend this course to anyone until then.

As long as you read the book and practice any sort of problem that he does step-by-step with the class, as well as study the project slides, you have what you need to know for the exams. He doesn't list out topics for studying, but he also prefaces his course with advice such as, \"get one last good nights rest tonight, that's it for the semester,\" and \"everything you heard about this course is absolutely true.\" Regardless of if it is the case, it's imperative that you get stared on the projects early, and read the textbook. \r\n\r\nThis is not an easy course, and this Professor understands that, but the difficulty in the course does not stem from administrative BS or weird rules.

The difficulty of the exams he gives usually is written by whoever is proctoring the course. In CMSC 216, the exams given were written by Yoon so it was pretty hard. In CMSC 412, Shankar wrote his own exams, which were rather fair if you knew the material (much fairer than exams written by Yoon or Kruskal). \r\n\r\nThe reason why I give Shankar 4 stars is literally because I think he did an ok job teaching 412.
