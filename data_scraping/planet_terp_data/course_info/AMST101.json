I could tell that she cared a lot about our learning along with our two TAs. Grading was very lenient and it is very easy to get an A. Participation in lecture (attendance) and discussion is a grade but all you have to do is show up for class and participate a few times in discussion to get an A. There were readings and/or videos along with a response paper due every week. The readings and videos sometimes took a few hours to read or watch which was kind of annoying. The response papers were 300-500 words but they aren't formal and they aren't individually graded (there's a overall response paper grade which you get at the end of the semester). They were also posted to a discussion page so everyone in your class could view your responses, which in my opinion, made it hard to get really personal with the topics because I didn't want my peers to read some of my responses that would be very personal to me. I would say that my biggest concern taking this class is the lack of grades. The first grade was the midterm grade which came a few weeks after it was due, so it was hard to know how you were doing grade-wise in the class until the very end. My TA facilitated great discussion which enhanced my learning on the topic, and the ~7 guest lecturers throughout the semester were engaging and great to listen to.
