The lectures were helpful though, because he would basically tell you exactly what you needed to know for the exams.

The only grades were 3 exams (the final is not cumulative), 2 papers (5 pages each), and participation. The papers were extremely hard to write because the topics were kind of dumb. It also all depends on the TA you get, because they grade all of the exams/papers/participation.

I am an engineering major, and music is not really my thing. But this class was so well designed that I couldn't help but enjoy it and do well. Rios picks case studies that  emphasize the point he is trying to make: the close relationship of music and culture. By the end, he creates a bigger picture that really stays with you.

It's not exactly what it sounds like.

Also your experience in the course will really depend on the TAs, as they grade exams, and papers. Dr. Rios is a great lecturer and the only negative thing I have to say about him is that halfway through the semester, he stopped using pretty much any text in the slides, only keeping the examples (music/videos). I think he did this because of low lecture attendance. It was frustrating because your notes were literally the only resource left to study for exams.

Her study guides basically just list every topic and term she discussed in all of her lectures, which is pointless when it comes to knowing what will be on the exam.
