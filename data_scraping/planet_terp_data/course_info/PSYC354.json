There is two exams; a midterm and a final, not cumulative and all multiple choice. To study, I watched back the lecture recordings.

As a UTA myself, I am appalled at how the TA's have been grading assignments, ESPECIALLY the workshop/group project assignments. They're quite literally out to destroy your grade.

Also, apparently the whole psyc dept is so pressed over APA formatting. Please, I could care less.

The lecture is very interesting, insightful, and really helps you understand the scope of topics in society. I believe everyone should take the time to go to these lectures. The lectures are also very skippable, so if you don't care enough, you don't need to go.\r\n\r\nNegatives: Grading is insanely harsh, inconsistent, and defensive. \r\n- If you want a good grade in this class, you need to follow the rubric to a T for EVERYTHING. My OpEd did not deserve the high grade it got, but it only worked because EVERYTHING I did was based on the rubric. Can't take off points if there's nothing wrong with it based on the rubric. Was the purpose of the OpEd to write well or write based on the rubric? The rubric, I guess.\r\n- Basically got my grade destroyed (A vs. A-) by 1 assignment that wasn't to the T. Tried asking for a regrade, got the \"nope lol.\"\r\n- Regrade requests are offered. If you decide to take this class, you need to use them. I didn't care much about it until it was too late and I realized I lost points on SUPER pointless stuff.\r\n- Dr. K enables her TAs to grade harshly. She stands by their grading more than half the time (and the rare times I got some crumbs back were the other less than half). So all the other comments saying the TA grading is insane, it's because Dr. K enables them to.\r\n- Her exams are all multiple choice and open note, but she DOES NOT RELEASE THEM. Which means you don't know what you're losing points on, you don't know where you're going wrong, you can't learn from what you're doing wrong, and based on the content of this class, there is a LOT of answers that can potentially be very subjective. You will never know unless you ask to see them. \r\n- A lot of busy work. I did not find value in most of her assignments. Assignments are more \"make sure you follow the rubric\" and not the actual content yourself.\r\n- APA formatting. I personally didn't have a huge issue with this since I learned from how ridiculous it was in PSYC221 (which was equally as bad in terms of APA formatting), but the emphasis on APA in this department is pretty ridiculous, and this class is no exception (had 1 error which also destroyed my grade once). My literal class on research methods and writing cohesive research papers (PSYC300) didn't even grade harshly on APA formatting.\r\n\r\nOther comments:\r\n- The workload is easy. It's easy to do well in this class if you spend a lot of time stressing over the rubric and following it to a T. No matter what the assignment is asking you, you must do it based on the rubric. I would've finished with an A if I followed the rubric on the outline assignment and not what the assignment descriptions were.\r\n- Despite finding the course content interesting, I could not bring myself to go to lectures after the first 3 weeks. It felt like a waste of time when the assignments weren't even emphasizing learning the content.\r\n- All of the other comments about grading are VERY true. At least the teaching team is responsive to regrade requests. Just make sure you use it. I've had to submit 3 and I got points back for all of them...\r\n- Overall, the grading for me killed this class. I really wanted to like it. But the amount of stress for the assignments was not it.
