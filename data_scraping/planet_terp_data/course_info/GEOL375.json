He has bright orange glasses and occasionally wears hot-pink pants. He is also hilarious and one of the most chill professors I've had. Lectures were entertaining, mostly because of his jokes about New Jersey. There was one midterm and one final (and an optional final project). The class wasn't hard. He definitely simplified a lot of complex concepts and made them  much easier to understand. I'm also pretty sure he curved significantly at the end of the course. Overall, I enjoyed this class and this bizarre professor.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2012-01-14T02:26:00Z"}], "department": "GEOL", "course_number": "375", "name": "GEOL375", "title": "Introduction to the Blue Ocean", "credits": 3, "description": "<b>Cross-listed with:</b> AOSC375.\n<b>Credit only granted for:</b> GEOL375 or METO375.\nOceans are an important component of the Earth System and this course builds towards Earth System Science education.
