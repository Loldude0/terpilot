She is also really educated and is a great teacher, but the class usually turns into a long Q&A session for questions that can be answered on google. But either way she explains everything really well. She is also very supportive of her students, and is the \"if you don't ask for anything, you won't get anything\" type. If you need help, ask. If you need support, ask. If you need extension, ask. Early. Class is very straighfoward. Put in a effort and you should be fine.

ANTH323 was an EXTREMELY interesting class, especially during the time of Covid. This class was essentially a public health class, but viewed from an Anthropological perspective, which was fascinating and made it really fun to learn about. During the class each week, we would have discussions on the readings (which were really interesting, shoutout to Cholera), and discussion was based around the questions that our peers asked and bouncing off of that. There were weekly 10-point online quizzes, which were easy if you payed attention in class and did the readings. There were a few papers, assignments, and a large group paper/presentation, but nothing too hard. I really encourage students of any and all majors to take this course, especially as it is so relevant right now. I am coming out of the class really feeling like I not only learned about the material, but learned how to ask meaningful questions and reflect on my studying. I really hope I get to take another class with Professor Icaza again, she's seriously the best and so understanding. Gives off cool aunt energy.

Grades come from weekly quizzes that you can control F the textbook for word for word half the time, in class participation (just attend and talk once per class) and a couple major papers. Feedback is very clear on the papers so while you may perform poorly on the first one, really take that feedback in, go to office hours, etc. and you can easily get an A average on those papers. One caveat is that the latter half of the course is group papers so you may need to do extra work because she \"balances\" groups so you are always ensured at least one person who does little to no work. She does somewhat take into account your work though and may raise your grade if you do more work than your teammates. \r\n\r\nEnjoyability Prospectus: B+ (Your mileage may vary):\r\nI think to a large extent this depends on your interest in the topic. As someone who has no particular interest in public health this wasn't exactly the most invigorating topic which made it a bit difficult to stay engaged in lecture and textbook readings (to be frank I didn't read the textbook). Prof Icaza is not a dry lecturer however and interacts with the class to a great extent so if this topic is interesting for you, this class is perfect. On the plus she also teaches various college skills on paper writing, citation, organization, etc. in addition to the basic pub health content as she is well aware of the FC nature of the class. Big props to her for that.\r\n\r\nOverall this course was a low work, relatively enjoyable course. If you need the credits this is a fantastic class with a good prof.

The assigned readings are never talked about in class but directly have to do with what our assignments are.

She is a little self-obsessed while also trying to be relatable to her students and it makes the class agonizing to sit through. She is also so unorganized. I didn't get feedback on a Critical Analysis (something worth 30% of our grade) until two months later and way after the second was due. Her incredibly late feedback is unhelpful and vague. Her rubrics are also incredibly vague making it impossible to complete an assignment feeling as if you did it to her liking and asking for clarification doesn't help as she somehow makes it more confusing when trying to explain it in person. I did extremely well in this class as it isn't too difficult I just would never recommend it unless you have to take it with her for your major or something. If you never went to this class and read a little bit of the assigned readings you could probably do fine as the lectures are useless.
