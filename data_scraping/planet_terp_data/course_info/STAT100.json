He's a straight forward professor who gives a ton of extra credit and additional opportunities to make up for low scores. If you attend lecture, pay attention in class, and stay on top of the assigned readings, this is a manageable class. Attendance in discussion is not mandatory (and most rarely go because the problem sets are literally done step by step for you in the tutorials) but he does give you extra credit based on how frequently you attended them. Content isn't hard either - again just attend lecture and do the readings. Acrobatiq is your best friend in this course. Practice exams he gives out for the midterms and final look exactly like the actual exams just with different numbers. Stay on top of everything and you will be fine.

Plus, the practice problems and the practice exams he posts on elms/canvas for exams are exactly what is on the exam.  Often he uses the same exact questions and just changes the values of the given numbers.  \r\n\r\nHe is strict about attendance and expectations, but reasonably so and if you show up to class you have nothing to worry about.

I talked to him during his office hours and he gave me a reasonable extension despite it going against his policy.  \r\n\r\nI did not get an A in class only because I didn't do the Acrobatiq (the online textbook) quizzes and towards the end I didn't hand in the R assignments - don't make the same mistakes.  You get three attempts for the quizzes (in Acrobatiq and elms/canvas) and the best score is taken.  The code is given to you for the R assignments, all you have to do is change certain details (because the code you are given is an example using different data and varibales) - but you are given instructions that tell you exactly how to do so.  Also with the R assignments, the three with the worst grades are dropped and not are included with your final grade for the class.

The assignments are provided with tutorials that walk you through the coding. You have to know the concepts from lecture before knowing how to alter the code in order to complete the problem set. Your section's TA use the discussion period to walk you through the tutorial as a class, explain what you need to do in the problem set itself, and then leave the rest of the discussion to work on the problem set and ask for help if you need it.

He does have some nitpicky rules (no hoodies, assigned seating (that you pick btw), attendance for big lecture, etc) but they\u2019re not bad after the first couple weeks. When he teaches he tells you what practice questions are similar to the ones on the exams, and the past exams you get to practice with are actually like the exams!!! Practice those twice and you\u2019re good, they aren\u2019t hard! Two midterms and the final. No quizzes, just online canvas assignments and worksheets. Mathlab homework was very little and you could really complete it whenever. Go to discussion and read the Problem Set Tutorials!!! before starting the actual Problem Sets because it is very close, if not exactly, what they want you to do. He also offers an insane amount of extra credit!!! Take him! He really sets up the class for success", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-12-30T19:01:57.925139Z"}, {"professor": "Ishfaaq Mohammed Imtiyas", "course": "STAT100", "review": "This class is very easy if you take a little bit of time to study for each exam and show up to class.
