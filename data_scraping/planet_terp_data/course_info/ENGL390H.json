As a vague summary, I took Marybeth virtually, with classes MWF. However, around 1/2 -1/3 of the way through the semester, she canceled all Friday classes for asynchronous work time. You have 3 \u201cassignments\u201d throughout the semester, although each is split into multiple peer review and draft phases. \r\nPros:\r\nYou can take the class from anywhere, whether driving or sitting outside of your next class. In fact, she actively encourages it.\r\nShe does not make you participate or even turn on your camera.\r\n*Very* easy A. Easiest class I\u2019ve taken since high school, if not earlier. *Maybe* 4 hours max on this class including in class time. The assignments don\u2019t even start until halfway through the semester. They are normally incredibly light assignments as well. For example, one was to write 4 topic sentences and 3 bullets under each one.\r\nMarybeth is incredibly lenient regarding deadlines.\r\nYou really don\u2019t have to show up and/or pay attention, as she posts all information online, and does not care about absences up to a point.\r\nCons:\r\nThe online format means I have made exactly 0 connections with my peers or the teacher (not Marybeth\u2019s fault, but still lonely).\r\nThis feels like the most ridiculous waste of time in my entire life. If you already know writing basics, you will probably learn nothing the entire time. For example, we spend pretty much our entire time going over basics such as that vs which, comma vs colon vs semicolon vs period, make the verb agree with the noun, etc. Other advice seems entirely useless, such as \u201conly include three main points.\u201d Like\u2026 huh???\r\nShe is incredibly flighty, and spends most of the time talking about anything but the class. This includes, but is not limited to Pokemon cards, Austin Powers, her various health issues, mooncakes, how she talks to her doctors about her health issues, how Zoom and Canvas are \u201cstealing all our data\u201d, and her research regarding her health issues (which at least is\u2026 vaguely related).\r\nShe often treats us like 5-year olds, calls us her \u201cM&Ms\u201d or \u201cdarling kittens\u201d which she has to \u201cherd\u201d. \r\nShe basically does not use Elms, and instead uses her own website. This would be fine, if she organized it in any way that was remotely even equivalent to Elms. Everything from class (which is not only everything said in class, but lots of additional information she just never covers) is in one big webpage, with weeks in reverse chronological order, but within the week is normal chronological. One way or the other would be fine, but the mixing makes it confusing. She does often condense all of the info for assignments into a Google doc or something similar, but not always, and that still means you have to find it.\r\nHer phrasing is often confusing, and she\u2019ll put things into instructions that she never said in class, or vice versa, or sometimes conflicting information, so it\u2019s never very clear what she wants.\r\nRegarding the loose deadlines: this can be nice, but if you are someone who likes to stay on top of things, this means that peer review assignments keep getting published later and later. Initially, they were published roughly midday Saturday, but it has gotten to roughly Monday morning now (due Monday night).\r\nIn summary, take this if you want an easy class with an easy A. However, you will probably learn nothing and be incredibly frustrated with her the entire time.\r\nShe also does not really provide any feedback other than the grades, relying only on peers. This means that if you are doing something wrong, you might not find out until too late (given that she doesn't even provide any grades until after the final assignment submission).", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-12-01T19:47:02.175013Z"}, {"professor": "Marybeth Shea", "course": "ENGL390H", "review": "To be honest, I do not think scientific writing is a priority class for a lot of students, and MBS made sure to acknowledge and accommodate for that.
