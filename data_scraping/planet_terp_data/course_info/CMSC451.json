In each class there's usually 2-6 little insights he forgets to mention, if you can catch those omissions and get him to explain them, you are a hero and it will be tremendously insightful for you and for every other student in the room.

Additionally, this may be subjective to each individual, but for me personally I felt that his lectures lacked structure which made it especially difficult for me to take organized and digestible notes. These are minor issues though-- my biggest disappointment was that he is not the kind of teacher that recognizes and reciprocates effort. I had hoped to TA this class in the future, and made a substantial effort to build a rapport with him, but he is simply just not the kind of professor that you can build a rapport with. He is not approachable in a way that makes you feel comfortable asking him questions, and I've seen/experienced several instances of him responding a bit curt/rudely to questions on Piazza.

It builds a lot of really useful skills and really helps you practice thinking critically.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\nThe class is organized very well. There's 5 homework assignments, each worth 10% of your grade with one dropped (so 40% total). They can take a long time to do and be pretty difficult, but you're allowed to work together on them. The TAs and prof are helpful during OH and responsive on Piazza. The hws help you to practice and build your understanding of the course content. The questions on the homework are about 1 or 2 levels more difficult than what'd you see on an exam, so they're good prep for that as well.\r\n\r\nThere's one midterm and one final, which is nice because the exam load is less. The midterm is 20% of your grade and the final is 40%, which imo is too much but ig that's the tradeoff for only having 1 midterm. The midterm was pretty difficult (avg 60%) but the professor says he intends to curve at the end of the semester based on where grades fall with the final. \r\n\r\nThe content is useful. I think I learned a lot about how to actually build and design new algorithms using existing algorithms or ideas (versus where in 351 you focus just on analyzing existing algorithms, not actually building anything new). That's the main difference between the 2 classes. He structures the class by first showing you 3-4 examples of algorithms using a specific technique (i.e. greedy) and then having you apply those algorithm's ideas to hw or exam questions. I think generally this class helped me to think critically about complex problems you'll encounter regularly in CS.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\nI felt the lectures were rushed and sometimes unclear. The professor would often handwave proofs especially towards the end of the semester to save time which resulted in them being difficult to read and understand. The book does have each proof in it written in depth, and is generally very good. I'm not usually a big fan of learning from textbooks and would rather get content from lectures, videos, or online, but I found this one very well written and helpful. I'd consider reading the textbook required to be successful in this class, even though the professor considers it \"recommended\".\r\n\r\nThis was a con for me but may be a pro for you. I personally kinda suck at proofs, and this class is *entirely* writing proofs (mainly proving your algorithm is correct). I think it was good experience to get but it was pretty difficult for me, especially at first. If you like proofs you'll do fine, but be prepared to be writing or studying proofs basically every day.\r\n\r\nA final being 40% of your grade imo is too much. I'd much prefer to have 2 midterms in this class and a lower weighted final.

I came into this class with not any more hope than to learn about some better ways to solve algorithm problems but am now considering getting a masters because I was very passionate about this class. \r\n\r\nIf you want to be great in this class, I suggest doing the textbook readings before class, because the information definitely can be a lot and gets covered quickly sometimes.

Set up Piazza and office hours times weeks before the semester began. He knows the textbook forwards and backwards. He follows the assigned textbook readings very closely. So if you're struggling to keep up during lecture, do the assigned readings beforehand. \r\n\r\nThe homework are long. HW3 (dynamic programming) was especially difficult. Make sure to start early (you're given 2 weeks to complete). The consist of 5 questions, typically all questions (except the NP HW) ask you to write an algorithm, prove its correctness, and state its running time. Use the textbook to complete homework early. Do not start any later than a week before the deadline. Each assignment took 10-20 hours to complete. Make sure to go to office hours to verify your thought process or you may get half credit on questions you incorrectly approach. The homework is however very fair and directly relevant to what we covered in class. HW average between 80-90%.\r\n\r\nI think what made me respect Prof Childs the most was that he was willing to answer questions during lectures fully. Even if this meant we did not get through supplementary topics at the end of the semester (had to cut out quantum lecture but posted for viewing on ELMS), he made sure to take any question serious and answer it without making anyone feel stupid. That's a classroom culture I appreciate. Sometimes however he does rush at the end to finish a proof if we got derailed with too many questions, but usually he saves it for the next class. \r\n\r\nDuring office hours, he was helpful. He gave hints on how to approach the homework. It was honestly helpful to explain my thought process and get that feedback from him. He allows multiple students in Zoom room at once or in person, so you get to listen to other students questions and perspectives as well, which is enriching. In regards to what 2 reviews down said about rapport, I will say that my interactions during office hours were mostly focused on course material and homework or practice problems. I think it is possible to build rapport, but you'll have to come with questions and willingness to share your interests. Most importantly, I felt like he did care about me and my understanding of the material. Sometimes he cracks jokes. \r\n\r\nRegarding exams, he made an especially difficult/ time crunch midterm (60% average), but he adjusted for it with a more lenient final exam (75% average). Overall cutoffs for the course: A-: 84, B-: 71, C-: 58. The biggest advice for exams I can give is to understand the homework well (what are the key concepts, thought processes), but then make sure to do as many practice problems as possible. Get your thought process verified by Childs or a TA. Big shout out to Aditya Acharya. He is the best TA for the course, go to his office hours if you can!! He makes his office hours basically into a discussion section for the course, white boarding concepts and helping get started on homework. \r\n\r\nAdvice: Start HW early (1+ week) so that you can spend 10-20 hours. Stay up to date with the lecture. Attend in person if you can even though its recorded. Take advantage of Piazza since Childs responds very actively. Take advantage of office hours, especially TA OH for homework. Prepare early for the exams. Good luck! Take him if you have the privilege and get a seat.

Don't panic though because the course has a huge curve at the end of the semester. Biggest piece of advice is to start the homeworks very early and go to TAs with any questions.
