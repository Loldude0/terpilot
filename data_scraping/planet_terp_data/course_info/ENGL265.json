I wanted to like this professor - on the first day she seemed really nice and accomodating, offering extensions on assignments if a student has too much going on and so forth - but was an ultimate let-down. She was incredibly last-minute in regards to many aspects. I know I may be last-minute as well, but I am not the teacher of this course and even I found myself wondering where information was on Blackboard and why I my e-mail had not been responded to. She makes her assignments incredibly vague and confusing and, honestly, expects far too much from her students for a 200-level course. It seems as though she wishes she were teaching a 400-level Queer theory course when she is in reality teaching a 200-level literature course. This is especially annoying to me considering the fact that it is apparently not counting as requirements for my major, despite the fact that it is the most rigorous course I am currently enrolled in. If you are expecting this course to be anything like other minority literature courses through this university, you are advised to understand that this is not the case. It is more a psychological research course than anything else. Professor McClure, if you read this ever, just be aware that this is nothing personal. You seemed like a great person and that I would enjoy you as a friend were I in your age group, but you have far too high expectations for mostly underclass-students who think they are in for a course focused around literature discussion.", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "", "created": "2012-12-08T22:33:00Z"}, {"professor": "Kerishma Panigrahi", "course": "ENGL265", "review": "The texts Kerishma picks out are really good if you are already interested in the subject matter, which I was. She is a pretty average grader, not too harsh, and she provides plenty of extra credit opportunities.

The quizzes are easy if you have done the assigned readings before class and there are lots of opportunities on them for extra credits. \r\nThe major assignments in this class include two papers and one presentation, both of which he gave us extreme flexibility with on content and still managed to be relevant and thought-provoking. \r\nOverall, the class is extremely fun and everyone in it seems to enjoy it greatly as class participation is very high and enthusiastic.

The readings and the material in general were very interesting, and the class was structured to be guided more by student discussion than by an instructor's lectures, which was a great way to approach this material.  However, this means he does expect a lot of participation (it was part of our grade), so it was necessary to actually do the readings (which a lot of people didn't).  The assignments required effort but weren't too hard, and I thought his grading was fair.

The class was tough (as a non-english major, it was a lot of reading, and at a fairly high level), but it was super interesting and definitely worth it. His classes were primarily discussion based, so if you didn't read beforehand, you can't really participate. \r\n\r\nThe first assignment he had us read (An Inventory Of Shimmers) was a total weed-out reading and not reflective of how difficult the rest of the course would be. I almost dropped out of the course because of it, but I'm glad I didn't. Bear with it, it's worth it! \r\n\r\nSome of the texts though will really challenge you, especially some of the theory heavy ones, bordering on pretentious (like the weed-out paper), or at least seem that way to a non-major. However, not all of them are like this, and imo only two of the reading assignments were like that, really. To be totally honest, I still don't *really* know what affect theory is actually, as it is very (intentionally?) nebulously defined in class and in the texts we read. I'm not convinced that anyone else actually knows what it is either lol \r\n\r\nOverall though, I would still recommend you take one of his classes if you get the chance. I learned a lot, though if you take it, be prepared to do a lot of reading and writing.
