So basically, if you take this class, I'm just warning you that you will likely be held accountable for the misprinted information in a textbook that you were required to buy, and that the professor wrote.

Dr. Tomlinson makes it manageable, though. We had a lot of amazing TAs as well, and altogether the class was much better than I thought it would be. She makes you do some certificates throughout the course, and while they may take some extra time, they are extremely beneficial to have professionally. The actual lectures are engaging, and she takes her time going through course content. I've emailed her and TAs throughout the semester, and they all seem to respond in a timely (1-2 days) manner. When reading reviews about Dr. Tomlinson I would urge you to consider that the actual class/class content (PSYC200/300) is a difficult and demanding one, and that much of that is not Dr. Tomlison's fault. Overall, all of my and my friends' interactions with Dr. Tomlinson have been pleasant, and I think she is truly one of the better psychology professors and an excellent lecturer.

Like what some of the reviews say, I originally thought that she was inconsiderate and doesn't really care about her students. However, I came to realize that its the opposite. Yes, the class has a lot of work and you will always have some sort of paper to write every week. Yes, the start times are really crappy. And yes, sometimes the content can be really boring to listen. However, Dr. Tomlinson is actually aware of these problems and is always asking for student feedback to make the course better. She understands that the class is a lot of work and was asking students on ways to improve it. She even said it herself that noy many people enjoy taking a research lab course and that the lecture times are awful. I recall her saying that if she could change them to a different time, she would. Also, I'm pretty sure that the amount of work she gives out for the class isn't even her doing as well. I'm pretty sure its the Psych Departments idea and this is like the standard PSYC300 cirriculum. (I know that other PSYC300 professors give out very similar work with a similar workload but I could be wrong about it being the departments fault).  I feel like she really takes the time to help address the problems that her students have and try to make the course as interesting and engaging as possible. The research examples that she use in her lecture are pretty interesting and easy to understand.  She really cares about her students and wants all of them to succeed. The assignments she gives out aren't hard but they are time consuming. If you ever need help, she will try her best to do so. For exams, she creates a practice quiz, offers a review session, and there is a discussion board where people can ask questions about the exam. She even adds extra credit to the exams and I believe she sometimes gives students points back on an exam on a question that almost everyone got wrong. She's a great professor and really isn't as bad as people think.

Never in my life have I been so tired all the time of doing the same repetitive boring crap every week and honestly feeling no satisfaction at all from doing work.

I put effort in to get my grade by the end of the semester and didn't care about how any of my research studies or experiments went, I just wanted the grade so I could stop suffering and move on with my day. Lectures are ok, but she goes a little too quick for my liking and makes collecting notes hard because her lectures repeat a lot of the same content and the overlap gets super confusing. One week I'm doing and observational survey and then the next week I am flipping that empirical paper into an experimental design. The class is messy and super overwhelming if you have to take this class I recommend taking a light semester around this class or you will suffer.
