As the other reviews say, he is prone to tangents and lets discussions between students in lecture go on for too long; there was one class where we did not move past the title slide of his presentation because of discussions between students. Additionally, in these kinds of back-and-forth discussions, one sometimes gets the sense that, despite his claims to the contrary, Koulish wants us to come away with his specific view on the law. All of this would be fine if the class was primarily about discussions, but the components of the grade are attendance, service hours/events, two exams which test mostly from the slides, and a final paper that you don't really need discussions to do well on. The total effect of this is that the class is frustratingly paced, and lectures are extremely unhelpful (but still required!!) to prepare for exams. Also, the materials (slides, etc.) often are not posted, posted super late, or of very poor quality. On the positive side, Dr. Koulish is very accessible and willing to work with students.
