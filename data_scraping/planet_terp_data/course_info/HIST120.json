He is one of the top professors at Maryland. Not only does he know what he's talking about, but he passes on that knowledge in an interesting and clear way. He wants you to learn, and it shows. He is extremely available and helping his students excel is his main priority.\n\r\nHIST120 is a basic introduction to early Islamic history, and is not too hard. There are 3 essay exams, but you review in discussion, so you have no reason to be unprepared for the questions. Discussion is mandatory, and you discuss certain readings. You can guess which reading is going to be discussed so you do not need to read them all.\n\r\nI loved Professor Borrut's class so much that I decided to take HIST429Y with him. This class was much more difficult than 120, but it was very interesting and we were able to discuss topics in depth which was great. The readings can be hard to keep up with, but as long as you do 2 of them or are good at bs-ing in class you'll be fine. The papers are only based on that week's readings so don't worry about keeping up with each article in depth. The papers are long but not so difficult. I would recommend giving in a rough draft beforehand for him to look at so you can edit to make it what he is looking for. I'm a business major, and got A's on all of my papers.\n\r\nOverall, if you don't want to work, don't take his class. But if you're looking to learn a lot from an intelligent and attentive professor then I would highly recommend taking a class with Professor Borrut.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2012-03-21T23:35:00Z"}, {"professor": "Antoine Borrut", "course": "HIST120", "review": "You can tell he loves the subject.

You definitely do not have to do all of it to get As on every assignment, but the less reading you do as it is assigned, the harder the assignments become.

If you're interested in history, even if you know nothing about the Islamic world, I can almost guarantee you will enjoy this class. Lectures are a solid 50 minutes of Professor Schine enthusiastically teaching you about that day's topic. She often had so much to say that we wouldn't finish the slides, but that was totally fine, because none of the assignments or exams relied on you being able to know every bit of information, and it never seemed like she was rushing any of the core aspects of the course. I personally loved just absorbing as much information as possible, especially when she would go on small tangents and give you fun facts. She is clearly passionate about teaching and enjoys lecturing, and is super friendly and approachable. Assignments and exams were never too hard (although they did involve some studying to be confident on), and the only part of the course I actively disliked was the term paper.
