Ramsey offers a lot of great advice in the leadership. He is very enthusiastic and engages the class very well. He is probably the most confident and poised lecturer I have ever had here. Class consisted of group presentations and activities pertaining to leadership. Ramsey sometimes gets distracted but he is very entertaining to listen to. The 2 1/2 hour classes are rarely boring. Its pretty much a guaranteed A since Ramsey is a very easy grader, unless you don\u2019t show up to class and don\u2019t do the assignments.

He is always full of energy during his presentations and is very knowledgeable of the topics covered. Most of the assignments in the course are very simple and straightforward, and the two quizzes we had were open-notes. You should note before taking his course that (1) he opted not to share his lecture slides, so you have to either take note or take pictures of the slides and (2) the class asks for quite a bit of involvement, so be prepared to do some activities during class. All in all, this is an easy course where you get exposure to different kinds of leadership models.
