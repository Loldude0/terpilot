This course is pretty dry and dull in terms of material, so I am not sure if any other teacher would've made it more interesting for me, but Dr. Yoon certainly did not.\r\n\r\nI took this course during a summer session so it was compacted into classes every day for 6 weeks. We had one midterm exam, a home work every week and a final exam. I felt so inadequately prepared for both exams, and the homeworks were tedious busy work. On top of that he assigned a coding project in C that was a simulation of the MIPS pipeline process (You learn about this during the class) and it was the second hardest project I ever took on and I felt it was just useless busy work. \r\n\r\nThe midterm was incredibly long and ridiculously packed with material not many were familiar with. He even said he anticipated low exam scores because people would not finish on time. For the first exam, we originally had 85 minutes, however since there was no class after ours let out he extended it to 100 minutes because people needed more time. This was the same situation for the final exam only no time extension. I barely got time to go to all the questions and just attempt them. \r\n\r\nThe one thing that makes this class with Yoon worth it, is it can be a passable class since he gives a butt load of extra credit and partial credit for just attempting questions but not necessarily answering them correctly.\r\n\r\nBecause of the unreasonable amount of questions on exams, the difficulty of the project and homeworks, the average of the class was a 56%. So Yoon curved the course NICELY. I ended up with a 66% and that was good enough for a B- .\r\n\r\nI like Yoon as a person and he's very helpful in his office hours but he still isn't very clear on the material a lot of times. Since I do not know how the other teachers are for 411 I cannot suggest taking them over Yoon. If you have to take Yoon just remember these things 1) The exams are unreasonably long and nearly impossible to get an A on, but he gives a lot of partial credit for simply attempting questions. 2) The project he assigns is hard and unnecessary busy work. 3) He isn't very effective as a lecturer, and does not give enough resources and practice materials to prepare you for exams.

The material is artificially made 20x more confusing than it is (and it's already pretty confusing) by Dr. Yoon's disorganized, scattered lecture style. I never knew how topics were connected or how they related to each other or how they fit into the bigger picture of the course. We were given maybe 1-2 examples of problems to solve for each topic (if that), but most of the exams were problem solving variations of topics we had not seen examples for. We were similarly expected to solve homeworks entirely on our own with no peer help, when we had never seen examples of those problems before in lecture or otherwise. And this would be fine if the problems were straightforward, but he usually throws in a little curveball that completely changes the entire approach to the question. \r\n\r\nAnd then, on top of all that, he teases us by saying the homework problems and exam problems will seem \"so simple\" when we see the solutions. It was infuriating every time. \r\n\r\nYou will likely pass the course if you take it, because he curves.
