Physical culture refers to a broad range of movement practices including sport, play, rehabilitative exercise, health and fitness training, and recreation and leisure. More specifically, we challenge the idea that historical physical culture practices--and the scientific processes from which they were derived--were 'neutral' or 'objective'; rather, we explore the cultural, social, political, and economic contexts shaping physical culture knowledge, study, structures, and policies across American history. The goal is for you to learn and apply techniques of historical analysis to develop a critical understanding of how knowledge about, and practices of, physical culture supported a particular social order via the construction of difference, norms, and/or hierarchies, and ultimately contributed to some of the inequalities that endure today.", "geneds": ["DSHU", "DVUP"], "sections": [{"section_id": "0101", "professor": "Shannon Jette", "total_seats": "14", "open_seats": "1", "waitlist": "0", "times": "MW 10:00am-10:50am | W 1:00pm-1:50pm"}, {"section_id": "0102", "professor": "Shannon Jette", "total_seats": "14", "open_seats": "10", "waitlist": "0", "times": "MW 10:00am-10:50am | W 2:00pm-2:50pm"}, {"section_id": "0103", "professor": "Shannon Jette", "total_seats": "14", "open_seats": "14", "waitlist": "0", "times": "MW 10:00am-10:50am | W 3:00pm-3:50pm"}, {"section_id": "0104", "professor": "Shannon Jette", "total_seats": "14", "open_seats": "14", "waitlist": "0", "times": "MW 10:00am-10:50am | F 10:00am-10:50am"}, {"section_id": "0105", "professor": "Shannon Jette", "total_seats": "14", "open_seats": "14", "waitlist": "0", "times": "MW 10:00am-10:50am | F 11:00am-11:50am"}, {"section_id": "0106", "professor": "Shannon Jette", "total_seats": "14", "open_seats": "11", "waitlist": "0", "times": "MW 10:00am-10:50am | F 12:00pm-12:50pm"}]}
