Somehow that was not the case at all. You hardly learn in class and they expect you to watch recorded lecture videos outside of class. I wouldn\u2019t normally mind that but these are like four hours worth of lecture videos. This class goes heavily into the fermentation process but doesn\u2019t discuss history like how or why fermentation created civilization (which is odd since that\u2019s the name of the class). We are expected to take weekly quizzes on lockdown browser on these four hour videos. They will tank your grade if you don\u2019t do well and I think I\u2019ve only gotten a perfect score once. They ask for very specific answers so you almost always need to watch the lecture videos. I have learned absolutely nothing in this class and 100% regret taking it. The projects were easy but honestly quite stupid (making business proposals and creating a law). I wouldn\u2019t recommend this class to anyone. Dr. Peer is nice but that\u2019s about the only good thing I can say. The recorded lecture videos were just rough.", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "B", "created": "2022-12-16T04:13:17.674007Z"}, {"professor": "Wendy Peer", "course": "AGST130", "review": "Save yourself the stress.

To what extent are our past and current attitudes towards fermented foods rooted in historical and cultural imprints? Explore the central role of fermentation in human history and culture, the basic microbiological processes underlying fermentation processes, and the processes used to produce and distribute fermented foods. Find out how the fruits, grains, and dairy products used to produce fermented foods are grown and selected.  Students will learn about the development and modern use of fermented dairy products, pickles, bread, tea, chocolate, wine, beer, distilled liquors, and pharmaceutical/manufactured products.\n<i>There will be 5 required live synchronous meetings via Zoom througout the semester. Please see instructor for details. There will be a required live/synchronous meeting on the first week of classes via Zoom on Monday, 8/30/2021 at 5pm. If there is a time change to the meeting time, this will be communicated via ELMS.</i>", "is_recent": true, "geneds": null}
