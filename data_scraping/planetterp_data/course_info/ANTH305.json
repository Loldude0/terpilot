Guest lectures every class, no exams, 2 midterm papers, 300 word free write reflection each week. There is an attendance grade I think its 10%? The final is a group presentation and a group paper. I wish Professor Bravo taught more however, only a few of his classes were taught by him and he was really passionate and a strong lecturuer. Some of the guest lectures put me to sleep, but I always looked forward to coming to this class to find out who the next guest lecturer would be. Covered a huge arrary of archeology and you did not really have to learn the material becuase you weren't tested on it. However, I found that I was really engaged with the lectures and found them interesting so I was learning the material with no pressure.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-12-28T00:13:24.815836Z"}], "department": "ANTH", "course_number": "305", "name": "ANTH305", "title": "Archaeological Methods and Practice", "credits": 3, "description": "<b>Prerequisite:</b> ANTH240, ARTH200, or CLAS180.\n<b>Cross-listed with:</b> ARTH305, CLAS305, JWST319Y.\n<b>Credit only granted for:</b> ANTH305, ARTH305, CLAS305, or JWST319Y.\nA team-taught, interdisciplinary course discussing theories, methods, and ethical issues in the practice of archaeology.", "is_recent": true, "geneds": null}
