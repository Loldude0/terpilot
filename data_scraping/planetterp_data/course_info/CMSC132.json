I had this guy for 131 and 132. He's probably one of the better teachers in the department. He's a decent teacher. Not incredible. He is good at conveying the information, and you will learn the material pretty well. However, there are a few majors problems.\r\nFirst off, I don't think he cares much about his students. He is really into himself, and if you get in his way he will stomp you into the ground. Yes, he will teach you what you need to know, but he makes it fairly obvious that he doesn't care much about the students, but more about the fact that his boss wants him to teach in a certain way. Everything usually needs to go the way that he wants it, otherwise he will get angry.\r\nA big problem with his grading and tests is that he stresses trivial stupid points that don't have much to do with the class. Some of the tests will have not much concepts, but some stupid esoteric stuff about Java that does not really matter.\r\nAnother big problem was that he used lecture slides made by the department that he didn't like. He was always commenting on how the slides were wrong and stupid. Well, if he didn't like them, then he should make his own.\n\r\nHe's a little bit rude as well when it comes to dealing with students, and helps very little with actual exam preparation in the weeks before the final.\r\nOverall, 131 and 132 aren't too bad. The projects take some time, but if you work hard you can get an A. You should probably take this guy over some of the other 131/2 professors, but you should know what to expect.

He is decent at lecturing most of the time, but that is not too much of a merit, since he just reads off slides. I have asked questions both in class, and in office hours, and I have never received a satisfactory answer. For example, one time in class, he offered an opportunity for us to ask questions about the current project we were working on. When I asked a question, he told me my question was too complicated to understand, and instead of letting me clarify, he instead told me that he wouldn't answer my question, and would be moving on to the next topic. I decided to go to his office hours to try and clarify my question. However, he would not even let me finish my question before interrupting, and repeatedly telling me my confusion regarding the project was because I had not read the public tests (which is a solution not remotely related to my original question). He was very rude and discourteous the entire time I was in his office.\n\r\nHe uses Piazza (sort of like a forum), under the pretense of having TAs or fellow students being able to help answer questions regarding the class. However, he only uses Piazza as a way to avoid answering nuanced questions himself. This was quite obvious the other times I had attended his office hours, when he would simply tell me to ask my question to the TAs instead.\n\r\nAs noted in other reviews, he stops lecture to call out students unnecessarily for the most ridiculous things. Aside from it not being funny, it is quite embarrassing to be put on the spot like that.\n\r\nHe is able to still be popular among students because he makes frequent jokes all throughout class. While some of them can be funny, a lot of the jokes I find to be annoying. He jokes about marijuana, cocaine, drinking, etc., in order to project a \"chill\" image which the typical college student will find hysterical.\n\r\nTo summarize this review, Nelson has repeatedly proven he is rude, unable to answer questions that are nuanced, and desperate to be liked.

His lecture slides are an amazing resource, sometimes better than the textbook (which, for 132, I highly recommend you get, even if you\u2019re a Java expert, as it contains a lot of powerful concepts and goes into detail on some foggy areas beyond the 132 curriculum that are still good to know).\n", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "B+", "created": "2015-04-06T01:17:00Z"}, {"professor": "Larry Herman", "course": "CMSC132", "review": "I would like to start off by saying that Herman is not as bad as many people say. I feel that most of the low reviews he gets are from freshmen who are not prepared for the amount of work this class will take. With that being said, I will give you as honest a review of him as I can. Keep in mind that this is my second high level programming class (I'm an EE major so I already saw many of the concepts presented in this class in my 150 class)\n\r\nI'll start off with the bad. Herman can be kind of an asshole at times. He follows his syllabus to the letter, so if he specifies that he  will only answer programming questions in office hours, HE WILL ONLY ANSWER THEM IN OFFICE HOURS. Like even for simple yes or no questions, he will only answer them during office hours which can get really annoying.\n\r\nHis exams are another negative point. For a 100 level programming class, I felt that there were unnecessarily difficult, and this was having already seen most of these concepts in another class already. His exams are often extremely specific, sometimes testing concepts that were only vaguely mentioned during a lecture and are often unnecessary to know for practical programming purposes.\n\r\nWith that being said, Herman is an extremely good teacher. I honestly thought he was a good lecturer, may not have been the most interesting but hey, you try and keep this stuff interesting through 5 different lectures of the same topic. If you want to be successful in this class, go to his lectures as much as possible. I would also recommend using his office hours a lot, not because he will only answer questions during them but also if you ask him a question then you will get a detailed and thorough answer that will almost surely help you. \n\r\nLike I said, I have seen most of the programming concepts presented in this class in a previous coding class, however, I still found his projects to be rather straight forward. If this is your first high level programming class I would suggest starting early, but you should not have difficulty completing them on time and getting a good score on the project.\n\r\nOverall, I would recommend Herman if you really want to learn the topics presented in 132.

You need to understand and memorize EVERYTHING he mentions, even in passing, to excel in the class, and you need to start on programming projects much sooner rather than later because they are deceptive when you first read the description.\n\r\nIn detail:\r\nMr. Herman is the best lecturer I have had in the past five semesters. In addition to knowing the course material, he is typically capable of conveying it to the class. His M.O. is to lecture using PowerPoint slides, asking the class if they understand before he discusses examples. MOST of these slides are posted on Blackboard a few days later, but they often have questions without answers on them. The examples that he presents in class are always basic illustrations of the topic at hand. He also maintains the class's interest when he talks about the more pedantic aspects of OOP by seamlessly working brief, amusing comments into his lectures.\n\r\nOn the other hand, however, I must remark that the class is heavily geared toward audial instruction. That is, the \"learn by doing\" aspect of the class is lacking. I was disappointed that there was little middle ground when it came to the difficulty of assignments. While the worksheets in discussion were similar in difficulty to the lecture examples, projects were significantly time-consuming. Part of this may have been because while I personally learn best by reading the book/writing code, the text for the class only discusses data structures, and not other  topics covered in the class (Out of five, only the second and third projects focused predominantly on creating data structures. The first was a review of CMSC131, the fourth was about graph traversal, and the fifth was about multithreading, I/O, and connecting to the Internet).\n\r\nFurthermore, tests were obnoxious, in the sense that perhaps 20% of each test dealt with trivia. In the case of the final, this took the form of, \"Do you happen to remember this fact about Java that I mentioned offhand halfway through the semester, and that you probably never used when you were completing the projects?\" The rest of each test was either writing code or tracing a program. The grading is stringent - I recall losing 8% on the second exam because I implemented (correctly) an O(n^2) algorithm instead of an O(n log(n)) algorithm. Basically, in most cases, it does not suffice in this class to get your program to compile and function correctly; you must also write it efficiently and know other ways you could have achieved the same functionality.\n\r\nAll in all, Mr. Herman has been my second-favorite teacher at UMD (after Prof. James Schafer of the Math department), and a few, but not all, of my complaints about the class are not his fault. I was actually signed up for Mr. Emad's section of 132 at the beginning of the semester, but I switched out immediately after sitting in on one of Mr. Herman's lectures. Best decision so far of my college career.\n\r\nOne final note: as you progress through the class, make a condensed version of your notes to serve as a rudimentary study guide for exams.

However, I really enjoyed his teaching style. He gives plenty of examples of concepts, and he puts a significant amount of effort into making comprehensive practice exams and homework assignments so that you are well prepared for the midterms. You can also download his slides and (some) code examples after class to further examine them. \r\n\r\nHe does not allow electronic devices in class, and if he catches you using one, he will not hesitate to call you out. I thought that was annoying at first, but his philosophy is that you should be actively listening to his commentary rather than writing everything down on the slides. In fact, when he sees people writing slide material in their notebooks, he won't stop them but he will interject with something like \"you don't have to write this stuff down because the slides will be on ELMS later.\" I think that his philosophy worked well for me, but your mileage may vary of course. He is also very knowledgeable about Java and the Object-Oriented paradigm and will write notes to himself to correct unclear information in his slides or to investigate the answer to a question he was asked.\r\n\r\nThe homework comes in the form of coding projects. His project descriptions are very well defined (albeit lengthy) and help reinforce the material covered in lectures. However, they are graded pretty slowly (the last four projects have not been graded yet as I write this review), but maybe that will change in the future. \r\n\r\nHe also makes a good attempt to engage with his students. He frequently asks questions throughout the lecture to his students and corrects them if necessary. As a bonus, I think he genuinely wants to entertain us and be friendly. For one, he always suggested saying your name when you answered a question. During the last half of the semester, he raffled chocolate and other candy using a specialized program he made. And lastly, you can count on him to try to crack a few jokes every lecture (and even in his assignments too).

(NOTE: I had Nelson first semester and received a very good grade so 132 with Fawzi was a shock. I have completed the course but chose to leave it optional out of confidentiality).\r\n\r\nFawzi is too fast paced in lecture. On top of that his powerpoint are next to useless and he doesn't record lectures. On top of that he doesn't give fair exams in my opinion. I will admit the midterms were fair, but they test the smallest details which you wouldn't need in the real world or which a compiler would pick up. For example, on one of the exams I declared a variable incorrectly, with the rest of my code is logically and syntax correct I only received 2/14 points. I approach external TA's who said I should receive points, but when I approached Fawzi on the regrade he refused to give points back and gave an excuse as to why. In additions we only had 2 exams unlike other classes, where they would split we had all of OO(Object oriented programming) and the entire second exam on every DS (data structure). \r\n\r\nOutside of the course work to sum up Fawzi in a few words:\r\n- shrewd/out right disrespectful \r\n    - Doesn't help in office hours. Always acts like he's better and we know nothing.\r\n- not lenient at all\r\n     - Was sick and couldn't make it for a quiz. Fawzi told me either to come for the quiz or receive a 0 (this was the second time I was sick and couldn't use a self attested note). Especially for a time while we are still in a pandemic this was out right disrespectful and foolish that he is willing to risk the health of his TA's and students for a quiz.  \r\n- doesn't care about his students mental or physical health\r\n   - Over this semester I was struggling with my mental health a bit and when I approached Fawzi about his essential response was I don't care. He is not as nice and caring as nelson, I didn't receive any help throughout the course during this. Outside of that office hours were always packed and the TA's were quite bad. \r\n- comes off as some high achieving professor with lots of publications and no time for his students when in reality he's a lecture (massive ego problem)\r\n\r\nOutside of this his class is taught like we are all high end comp sci people who know what we're doing. His exams once again are more difficult than nelsons. If you could I would avoid Fawzi at all cost and take Nelson. Nelson was one of the best professors I've had across all departments. \r\n\r\nOther Notes (sorry if repetitive to some other parts of the review):\r\n- Doesn't give practice exams\r\n- Doesn't tell us a concept list like Nelson or any other teachers\r\n- Refuses to record lecture \r\n- Steep late penalty (20% off your highest score if submitted at or after 11pm. 100% off after submitting 24hrs after the deadline).\r\n- 1 practice packet with questions that don't resemble exams a week\r\n- Quizzes were very hard for weekly assignments (we also didn't know the context)\r\n- Purposely goes into harder concepts which aren't relevant material to the course (refers to 351 and theoretical CS concepts we don't learn a lot). \r\n- Final Exam is the worst. 30% of the grade. Everything we wouldn't have been tested on for an FRQ was there. You cannot expect first time students with no experience to come in and redo parts of their project by hand. You cannot make students code out concepts you referred to for 5minutes in a lecture. You cannot make students code a question we have never seen a code example for and something which was barely touched in class. A final is cumulative that includes everything we were taught not everything after the midterms and the concepts we barely went over. \r\n- Labs also aren't too helpful and I think he should adjust the labs to have a due date of completion so students actually do then and cut down on the weight of the final exam. a final worth 30% dropped by grade from B to (well you can do the math for that :)). \r\n- Projects in others classes are worth way more overall than ours. \r\n\r\nFinal thoughts: I wish I took nelson when I had the opportunity to while registering.

He makes jokes and I think he tries to be an engaging professor. I will however say that he uses his pencil and a paper to visualize what he is describing, and his handwriting is very ineligible and he has to erase so many times that I can't help but bother about the amount of eraser dust he produces.

He doesn't record lectures because he wants to encourage students to attend to his lectures, so you kind of always have to attend his lectures since you will miss out a lot if you are absent as his lecture slides are lackluster, but frankly, if you study the department's slides, I don't think his lectures and slides were particularly helpful at all.\r\n\r\nAside from that, he is extremely unapproachable. I'm not sure if he is \"rude\" per se as I haven't had a proper conversation with him, and he can be pretty sweet like asking \"how are you?\" to his students, but when someone asks him questions, he can be really condescending. I think I asked him questions only two times throughout the semester, during the exam and after the lecture, and both of the times he was very cold. Maybe I was asking dumb questions to his eyes, because he does seem to love whenever his top students ask advanced questions during the lecture.\r\n\r\nI think he also makes his exams on his own, and in my opinion, those are much harder than the practice exams provided by the department. I did decently on the second midterm and the final exam, but I did pretty badly on the first midterm, which hurt my grade the most, because I had no idea his exams would be as difficult. I'm not saying his exams are the worst, but you definitely need to study consistently on everything that he covers, and he also teaches things that the department curriculum does not seem to include just because he \"likes\" those particular topics.\r\n\r\nHis projects are enjoyable though.

The exams test you on the most intricate tiniest details possible that you will NEVER EVER need to know in the real world. It is hard to remember every small detail. Such as knowing the asymptotic complexities for the insertion of a linkedList, knowing what URL stands for, etc... There are only two exams whereas other classes split into three exams.

Fawzi's lectures are extremely fast paced, he doesn't record lectures, nor does he allow electronic devices (laptops/tablets) out in class at all. Not to mention, you can never get any access to his previous exams so there is NO understanding of just how much we need to study or what needs to be studied. The study question sets that get posted on canvas have ZERO answer keys so there is absolutely no way in knowing if you are getting the correct answers or not.

If you are given a choice between Nelson and Gonzales, then it would be better to take Nelson anyway. \r\n\r\nGonzales for the entire semester wore a face mask, even when coming to lecture. Evidently he cared a great deal about the risk of COVID infection. Also evident was that he did not care about this enough for his students, because the office hours room was a windowless room in the AV Williams Building with no ventilation in which students were supposed to go to be crammed as sardines. If there was ever a greater risk of infection, it was this place. However much Gonzales cared about his own health, he did not care enough about that of his students to get a different room for them. \r\n\r\nWith regards to the projects, the only advantage over Nelson was that the first deadline would not cost you points if you missed it, but was rather just extra credit. However, the extra credit would barely be one or two points. I doubt that it would be enough to swing your grade by any significant amount either way. \r\n\r\nGonzales cannot lecture or teach well at all. His teaching style is terrible, with no continuous train of thought. \r\n\r\nHis slides are atrocious, with the code lacking basic things which he asks for in the same projects such as proper indentation and variable names. You are far better off using Nelson's slides for the subject. \r\n\r\nI stopped going to his in-person lectures early in the semester. I could not understand anything. He records his lectures anyway, so you can be confused at home instead of in the lecture hall.\r\n\r\nOffice hours were brutal and a complete mess. It was common to find a ten-person line of students for two TAs who were in attendance. \r\n\r\nIn any case, Gonzales would go to bat for his own TAs. He seemed to forget that this class was being run for the students and not for his teaching staff. He allowed them to cancel and reschedule their office hours however much they wanted.  You might end up in desperation at office hours, only to find out all the TAs cancelled last minute.\r\n\r\nBecause of the extreme latitude Gonzales gave his TAs, they abused it to the point where you would have days where there would be zero TAs at all, followed by days when there would be three or four TAs all at the same time. Never present when you actually needed them, of course. Most of the time, there would just be one brave TA (Dominic) holding down the fort reading through some crummy Google Doc office hours queue system instead of something respectable like the Quuly that Nelson used.\r\n\r\nOut of desperation I just stopped going to office hours. It was less effort for me to spend the weekend holed up in my room, than to waste time during the week trying to get a few minutes with a TA who would never show up. \r\n\r\nWhat was also frustrating was the sheer number of typos that Gonzales is capable of. During the final exam, he actually had to pause time for him to go through them. \r\n\r\nOn the second exam, he gave us some hashing question with some ridiculously large calculations. He realized that we were wasting our time on them and put up the values of the calculations on the projectors. Good luck if you were one of those people who had already wasted large amounts of time during the exam calculating things by hand. \r\n\r\nThis kind of flip-flopping and lack of consistency was typical. For instance, he allowed, then banned, then allowed again notes while doing the quizzes. \r\n\r\nGonzales provided little support for his exams. His \"practice questions\" would be mostly unrelated to the final exam and hopelessly RIDDLED with errors. You will spend more time trying to figure out what is wrong with the question than actually answering it.\r\n\r\nMost frustratingly of all, Gonzales always REFUSED to do the common-sense thing and provide answers to his own sample questions. He would constantly tell us to crowd-source answers on Piazza. Which of course, never happened. At least had past exams WITH SOLUTIONS that you could practice with which would make things dead easy. \r\n\r\nGonzales' communication was just very snarky and condescending in general, although he was decent enough in person. You will be going to him in person often, because he often does not resopnd to email. He would write things like \"as a treat for you all there will be no lecture today\". I wonder what that implies about his own evaluation of his own teaching. \r\n\r\nDiscussions were really depressing. My TA in particular would give a confusing explanation, then react sharply to the most innocent clarifications.", "rating": 2, "expected_grade": "B", "created": "2023-05-20T23:55:03.237755Z"}, {"professor": "Fawzi Emad", "course": "CMSC132", "review": "To start with the positives, Fawzi is genuinely a good lecturer.

Some are great, while others are very skeptical. Some TAs waste your time in office hours while others know how to guide you correctly, so make sure you know what you are doing and are willing to \"waste\" time in some cases.\r\nQuizzes: As mentioned, quizzes can be annoying, but they are good practice, so again, a two-sided coin\r\n\r\nOverall, take Fawzi if you can.

His midterms this semester were also extremely easy, but I think he was trying something new this semester with midterms, since they are generally known to be very difficult, but atleast for this semester the midterms were really easy and fair. In the beginning of the semester he mentioned that his final would be generally easier than his midterms which is why he weighs it 30% of the grade. However, the final was an absolute dumpster fire. Especially compared to the midterms, the final felt way too difficult. I also don't like how he has us do quizzes every week, and will tell TAs to not tell us what is on those quizzes, so there are many times I try and study for quizzes but what comes up on the quiz is not something that I studied, because I assumed the quiz would be about another topic. I also feel like his project descriptions in this class were not very good. They were extremely brief and many of the projects, except for a few exceptions, were really basic and uninteresting. I had him for 131 as well and I felt his projects in 131 were much better and creative. Him also not recording lecture and posting incomplete and not detailed slideshows really puts him down from other professors as I feel it is unfair that I have to struggle to catch up if I cannot make it to a single lecture due to sickness, or etc. Like there is no way for me to attend every single lecture 3 times a week for the entire semester. He also never gives us practice material with answer keys when it comes to these quizzes or tests and no previous exams to practice with. I would say there are definitely better options than him, like for 131 and 132, it would be better to go with nelson, elias, or pedram. Even Larry Herman would be better for 132 since he atleast records lectures and gives extremeley comprehensive project descriptions.

(Unless another section has Nelson, then it depends on your personality). \r\n\r\nPros: \r\n- The clearest, most focused and concise lecturer there is. Every lecture, he gives you exactly what you'll be expected to know: no confusion/ambiguity/wastes of time. You just have to be there, and you'll understand. I'm not lying: going to lecture felt like connecting a flash drive to my brain and downloading the entire course. He's just that good. \r\n- No recordings as is noted, but the slides are substantial enough that if you took notes in your lecture, you can find everything you need. \r\n- Extremely cracked at answering questions. Assuming you ask appropriate ones (no out of pocket ones), he'll be super clear and go in-depth. As a bonus, he'll often say \"I might ask you that on an exam\" when answering questions, then tell you the answer. I think at least 4 times in the semester, somebody's asked a question, Fawzi's said that, and then that question shows up on the exam (free points!). \r\n- Quizzes are veryyy predictable. I think I correctly predicted what would be on them for 8/10 quizzes we had. Essentially, he takes what you did the previous week, have a definition section, and a coding section which will be a slight variation of code done in lecture/lab. Essentially, if you study your definitions, do the labs, and remember the programming examples from lecture, you're guaranteed at least a 90 on all of them. \r\n- Exams are extremely fair. Exam 1: 85 median, Exam 2: 89 median, Final: 85 median. As mentioned before, he'll sometimes give you exam questions&solutions in lecture if you ask questions. Just like the quizzes, his exams are just definitions/applications of rules + coding problems. The coding problems are highkey easy: on every single exam, he stole a problem off of one of our labs, so if you study the labs, you'll be good. This really came to a head in the final: we had 3 programming questions, one was ripped straight off a lab, another straight off an example we did in class, and another straight off a project we did. Provided you study the code in the lecture examples, your labs, and your projects, you have nothing to worry abt :)\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Fawzi really does not exist outside lecture. If you have a problem, I don't think he'd be that flexible. He'll answer quick emails but nothing else.
