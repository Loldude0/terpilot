Lot\u2019s of time faculty came in to give a presentation or talk about what they did in their field of work. Attendance is required from an attendance google form, so you can get by with it on paper but the professor will know that you didn\u2019t show up. Assignments are pretty miscellaneous and very easy. It's bizarre to me that some people in the class failed it because they didn\u2019t do a single assignment, this is quite literally the easiest class at UMD. This class is either you get lower than a 40%, or just do the assignments that take no longer than 15 minutes each and get a free 100%.\r\nProfessor: She is super nice! She is a really cool person to talk to outside of class, as she is also pretty young for a professor. She is also pretty interested in cybersecurity so if you have an interest in that, she is a good person to talk to.
