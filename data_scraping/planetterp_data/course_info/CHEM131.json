Boy, was a I wrong. First of all, sometimes he was a little condescending when students would ask questions that he might have felt were stupid or obvious. We are students for a reason--we came to class to LEARN and ask questions.  Anyways, he's a complete asshole when it comes to getting points back on tests. I showed all of my work on a test and got the CORRECT answer but got a considerable amount of points off because I didn't do the work **exactly** how he had done it on the answer key. I showed him my work and he tried to say that I hadn't shown certain major things in my work. I POLITELY pointed out that I in fact had. He acknowledged that I had shown the correct work. AND THEN GOES \"yeahhh i don't think I'll give you the points though...\" Excuse me????? he says on his answer key that if we got a correct answer but approached it a different way, it was a valid reason to get points back. It just doesn't make sense. I've seen students come up to him and ask him a question, and when he doesn't want to answer, he just looks at them, smiles, and turns the other way. That's just rude, inconsiderate, and shows that you do not care. Especially in a Chemistry class, every point is important and he just doesn't care about the student, in my opinion. ALSO HE DOES NOT CURVE. When averages on the tests are in the 60's, you would expect an professor to curve. But, no. He REFUSES to curve. I don't know if it's because he's tenured now or is just jaded but it just doesn't seem like he cares whether or not we do well. Then, he gives you practice tests BUT NO ANSWER KEY. what is the point????? i have never understood professors that do that.In addition, he said he would ask a little over 40 clicker questions this semester so we could get a possible max of 10 extra credit points. INSTEAD he asked a little over 19 questions. With each clicker counting as 0.33 points, it was impossible for anyone to get the max of 10 extra credit points. We needed at least 30 clicker questions for that. Those points could have really helped, but again, doesn't seem like he cares.

If you don't know what you're doing, you're kinda screwed. I was lucky enough to surround myself with a group of friends and we worked through each one together (which she is fine with). She also does like 5-7 clicker questions before each exam to give you some practice. Those helped a lot and gave me some idea of what topics would be on the exam/what kind of questions to expect. Some clicker questions are meant to trick you. But she goes over them if most of the class doesn't get it right. And hey! Better to get tricked on a 1 point clicker question than to get tricked on a 8 point question on the test!\n\r\nBefore each exam and the final, she tells you exactly what she is going to test you on. \n\r\nPersonally, I never had a problem with timing on an exam.

He goes off on long tangents about material that's more suited to graduate students than to an intro course, constantly makes mistakes and corrects himself, and just generally makes a mess of everything he's trying to teach. I ended up not going to classes at all except for exams because my grades went UP that way instead of down, even with the extra credit clicker questions at the end of class.

The fact that Ondov was such a pathetic excuse for a professor is testament to his ability to inspire righteous anger in even the most uninterested students like myself.  Where to begin?  First, his lectures.  Allow me to sum up every Ondov lecture you will ever attend: He will use a combination of powerpoint slides and blackboard work to teach.  The powerpoint slides are ripe with mistakes and errors that students point out merrily every class, as finding one of his ever-present screw-ups usually results in extra credit.  This is also known as \"bribing students to not talk about how many times I mess-up\"  When he turns to further explain the complicated problems on the blackboard, you might as well turn off all your senses because he is about to start sprouting gibberish and incoherent nonsense for about 5-10 minutes.  Whenever you see him turn around, rest assured he is actually entering his own little world where everything he says makes perfect sense and unicorns fly across the sky on rainbow bridges.  Trying to follow his thought process is almost as challenging as mustering your will to go to his class at all.  In addition, his droning monotonous voice combined with the difficulty of following his spastic \"teaching\" results in the lecture essentially becoming a way to catch up on sleep.  I'm telling you right now, the only reason to ever attend his lectures are for the clicker questions that his TA will give at the end of class as a quiz grade.  \r\nThank god for those TA's.  Although some of them are extremely incompetent at grading your exams (which results in you having to meticulously go over your every test to get back your much-needed points) they literally carry the class on their backs with their discussion sections.  Pray for a good one.  \r\nHis office hours are really great if you love being talked down to and falling asleep in a chair.  Here's a personal experience from me: I emailed him after the second exam asking to go over it with him.  He responded a speedy month later.  When I went there to learn how I made my mistakes, he assumed I just wanted him to look over his test for mistakes the TA's made when grading (a testament to the number of problems they cause and his disinterest in helping his students).  He looked over my first couple problems and determined that my TA had actually given me more points then I should have.  He then proceed to LOWER my grade on the exam on his computer when I came to him for HELP in UNDERSTANDING THE MATERIAL. A more obnoxious thing to do to a student who comes to you for help I cannot imagine. I shouldn't end this review without saying at least one positive thing about him as much as he deserves it. Unfortunately, I can't think of one yet.\r\nAnother one of his great habits is changing the classroom and not telling the students until the last minute, or not at all.  As much fun as going back and forth across the campus is, I just want to learn Chem. \r\nI don't want you to think I took this class with no effort on my own either. It was the second time I was taking the class, and I have had a private chem tutor for a year and a half.  I still was getting 60's on his exams.  \r\nMy best advice for taking is class is this: I hope you are good at teaching yourself material because he sure won't.  Read the textbooks, do the practice problems and maybe you won't be completely lost.  That guy who posted beneath me may have the right idea about it not being high school anymore, but that doesn't really help when you're professor is incapable of getting the material across to you.  He is right about another thing too, Ondov knows his chemistry.  Unfortunately, that doesn't mean jack when he might as well be teaching the class in another language due to his total inability to teach.  Also he might be Ondov himself.

I'm so glad I did.\r\n\r\nOnce the announcement came out about who the new professor was, I saw that she was a first-time professor who just received her PhD in the Spring of 2022. I honestly thought this was a good sign because I figured she would try more than some of the more veteran professors, and she really does. Dr. Baxter comes prepared to class every day with good content in-hand. The class itself is great because she provides you with guided notes so that you just have to fill in blanks and do the practice problems yourself. It makes it so that you can get all of the information without struggling to write it down in-time. \r\n\r\nDr. Baxter also works really hard to keep the timing of the course on-track. During the first two units, we were ahead of schedule, which may sound grueling, but it's really great because then we're assured that we'll get through everything we need to before moving on to the next level of Chemistry. When she was absent and we started falling behind a little, she would record lecture videos for us to watch on our own. She really puts her students' education first. \r\n\r\nIn regards to grading, I really like how she does it. Yes, the exams do count towards a large portion of our grade, but so does the homework. The homework is graded on accuracy, but you have as many tries as you need, and it just takes off a small percentage for every attempt you get wrong. I know the grades on the exams are mixed, with an average around 52%, but I believe that if you put in the work to study on your own by reading the textbook and doing the practice problems she provides, you can easily score a B or an A. She gives you the resources you need--all you have to do is use them. She is going to do a curve at the end of the semester, which she said will be done by curving the average in the class to a 70%. So, if the class average is a 60%, those people will end up with a 70%. People with a grade greater than 60% will end up with a grade that is greater than 70%.\r\n\r\nWhen talking about our first semester chemistry experience with friends, I always talk about how great Dr. Baxter is and my friends say they are jealous. They often fall behind in lecture content and will not get through everything by the end of the semester, and they're not normally at the right place in learning where what they're taught in lecture is what they do in lab. My experience is the opposite. Most of the time, I feel prepared to go to lab because Dr. Baxter has already taught us a lot of the necessary information.

Her entire guiding philosophy is \u201chere\u2019s a textbook, figure it out yourself.\u201d Fine if you have 20 hours a week to blow on chem, bit of an issue if you\u2019re taking 3 labs. My biggest gripe with her is that she refuses to accept that things other than hard work and studying can have an effect on your grade. She offered a grand total of 3 points of extra credit on one test and that\u2019s it. I wound up getting super sick at the end of the semester and didn\u2019t have much time to prepare for the test. I still wound up taking it because I figured it was nothing more than a cold and some nerves that were fogging up my head and making it impossible to study. So I still took the final and ended up bombing it. I found out the day after that I had been suffering from Mono and a nasty ear infection in my left ear. I let Professor Baxter know this. I owned up to my grade but asked if I couldn\u2019t redo an assignment or two just to offset some of the points I might have lost. Her answer was flat out no, that the only extra credit offered was 3 total points for picking up tests from her office. I understand I\u2019m not entitled to a good grade in the class, but when a teacher has repeatedly shown that she doesn\u2019t care a lick about your grade, your out of school life, and your wellbeing as a whole, it\u2019s hard to have any shred of respect for them. Easily the worst teacher I\u2019ve had at this university. If I\u2019d had any interest in chemistry going into this class, she would have put me off of it.", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "C", "created": "2022-12-19T04:08:21.706641Z"}, {"professor": "Alice Mignerey", "course": "CHEM131", "review": "She's definitely not as bad as people make it out to be. It's going to be difficult to understand what is going on in class if you don't read the textbook since she doesn't really cover any conceptual ideas and if she does then it's covered in a very short amount of time and difficult to understand. The class is mostly going over practice problems and she does move fast but that is expected since they are only 50 minute lectures. She gives practice exams that are very similar to the actual exams that you receive, so as long as you understand how to do those and are able to do problems that are slightly different than the ones given on the practice exams then you should be fine. The averages on all of the midterms were in the 50s to low 60s and the final's average was in the low 50s, but don't let this scare you because as long as you put in the work then you'll do well. Before the exams always make sure to first have read all of the required chapters in the textbook and understand the concepts, do the practice exam given, and do the worksheets that are made by the TA and GSS leader.

Coming into gen chem, I had no proper foundation of chemistry (I did not take AP Chem and I only had 2 normal quarters of chemistry in 10th grade because of the pandemic). But on the first day, Dr Baxter made herself very clear that we do not need prior knowledge and that she wants us to succeed as long as we meet her half way. I was completely testify that this is true. She is very reasonable with the HW (which is an easy A by the way) and the due dates and if she makes a mistake she always acknowledges it and apologizes. Her course page is so so organized and it makes other students jealous. Literally, in September she made a calendar for the whole semester that showed what lecture would be covered and when the specific HW would be due and when the next exam is.  She makes guided notes for the lectures that go hand in hand with her presentations and they also serve as a study guide for when there are exams. She also posts answer keys to the guided notes after the lecture is over to ensure we have accurate information. I highly suggest printing them out before the lecture (as she does post them beforehand for us to do so). She also makes the discussion worksheets which are usually similar to the exams she gives. She is also always at her office hours and will always notify us if she cannot make it. At office hours she was so kind and nice to talk to and I was easily able to ask any question about chemistry that I wanted. I've been told that Alice Mingery (the other chem professor) is so condescending when asked questions, but Baxter has never been that way. She will explain everything so methodically and ensure that we get the proper answer. Now, she does expect us to practice and will emphasize us doing the practice problems given to ensure our mastery of the topic. She always says that the best way to master chemistry is through practice problems which I completely agree. Now I will be honest, going to lecture is not enough for this class. She does go at a very fast pace and there are many days I leave that class being completely confused. However what I did that I thought was really helpful was rereading her lecture notes (which are very clear) and finding the corresponding online textbook page that corresponds to that topic and doing the practice problems. That really helped. Going at a very fast pace for the chem lectures is nice because (A) it helps with the chem labs which may cover topics not covered in lecture and (B) It lets the information sink in more before the final. One thing that baffled me was that the exam averages were 50-60 for all three. However I managed to get a C on two midterms, a B on another midterm, and a B on the final (average was a D for the final). She also said that the final can replace our lowest midterm exam grade. Her exams are completely straightforward and there are usually no tricks to them. They are very similar to the discussion worksheets too. The one tricky part is the time limit which I admit can get some people (but that can be easily fixed with practice trust me). The final that I just took last week was identical to how her midterms were and they had no tricks to them  Its clear that Dr Baxter cares about her students and just wants us to have a strong foundation of chemistry. My TA was honestly not that great and I left her discussion after the second week and stopped going. I just used the discussion worksheet and the answer key and If I had a question, I would just go to office hours. Also don't trust the GSS because they do not follow Baxter's structure for the exams.  Baxter is not an easy professor as per say, but if you put in the work you will be able to do well.

Another thing, yes she did make mistakes during lecture, but some people make it out to be like she was all over the place and was not conveying the correct methods of how to solve problems. She might forget an extra number, put it in her calc wrong, add instead of subtract, small things like that where 99% of the time, her mistakes were caught and corrected.

Personally, I just have a really hard time picking up what's being taught in lectures (but it's not Baxter's fault, I just understand more when I'm able to go back to the dorm and walk through a problem on my own). I say that because if you find that you're having a hard time keeping up with Baxter during her lectures, I still strongly advise attending class. A lot of the time I wouldn't understand (completely) why a certain step was done in a problem or why some conversion has to be done in step 2 instead of step 4, but once I got back to my dorm and was able to walk through the problem myself, I would then understand/remember \"oh yea, Baxter said this because of this\" and then everything would fall into place.

Now lets talk about her final, her final was really hard. While Baxter was doing stoichiometry on their exam, Mignerey was doing complex thermodynamic questions. PRIOR, to the final exam I think she realized that her class average was so low that she was trying to give us options to help us pass the class (which is a good thing.) For example, she offered that if you were able to \"pass the final\" (meaning getting anything above the avg on the final) she wouldn't give you anything less than a c-. HOWEVER!

Please only listen to reviews who actually support their negative comments with factual information. I am going to break down the class for you, I took gen chem with him as a senior. He is not supposed to teach gen chem for spring 2024, however I still wanted to write my review in case he returns to gen chem or you are just curious...\r\n\r\nLECTURE:  Rainbolts designed our class to have modules, pre-lecture videos, AND lecture to synthesize information. Unfortunately rainbolt rarely ever made new material for lectures. The modules were supposed to be extra practice, however around week 2 it became quickly apparent that these modules are now our lecture material. \"Lecture\" consisted of these modules and rarely his own practice problems. He would often make comments about our uncompleted modules during lecture and even had the class \"break our papers in'' by scrunching them up with our hands, which I won't even lie made me roll my eyes but laugh. \r\nIf you have a hard time hearing far away professors or seeing a chalkboard, take another professor because he rarely wore the microphone and only projected the chalkboard to the class a total of 3-4 times. You have to set yourself up for success, and being able to see/hear lectures is vital to doing so. The pre-lecture videos are beneficial if you want them to be, it was nice to have an extra resource on top of our modules but often he would post them late. I will say though that him posting the prelecture videos late didn't even make sense to me because the videos are dated from 2019 and he literally just needed to repost them for us. Lastly, word questions in class properly or he will not answer it, say \"ask god\" or \"see me after class\" and your question will not be answered during lecture. \r\n\r\nQUIZZES/EXAMS: Quizzes were difficult but good study material for the exams. One thing that bothered me about the quizzes was no partial credit is given. No matter how hard you attempt it, or how close you get your answer, you won\u2019t get any partial credit at all. He also does not provide a quiz answer key afterwards unless emailed by multiple people to make one. He made a quiz answer key for one of our quizzes but sent it out the day before the exam, leaving no time to study the correct quiz answer for our exam. This was extremely stressful as a student trying to earn credit on quizzes for work and seeing what you get wrong so you can fix it! \r\n\r\nExams were fair but you have to study. Rainbolt said our exam 3 was our best exam yet however the average was the lowest of all 3 exams we took (excluding final, i'm writing this before our final exam). In total we will have 4 exams (including final). I was pleased after exam 1 when he provided us with the current class curve and even provided a spreadsheet to calculate our grades. It felt like this effort quickly dropped on his part when he told us the curve changed, but would not tell us by how much. As a student it's extremely stressful to have a low grade and not know the updated information on our curve. When I would speak with him privately he would give me more information on the curve but dont even bother asking this question during, before, or after class as he more than likely won't answer it. It should be noted that he does give a curve though and doesn't want his students to fail. Rainbolt set a fair curve early on but just not knowing how it would change is frustrating to me. \r\n\r\nRAINBOLT AS A PROF: I enjoyed Rainbolt as a person, he was kind and funny! You will see many reviews mentioning he's funny or cracks a good joke, which is true but I personally felt like some of these attributes quickly went away when the topic switched to chemistry. When asking rainbolt a conceptual question, it has to be thought out or he will not answer it. I suggest going to anyone else but rainbolt for chem help because often he won\u2019t even answer your question if you word your question weird or \"wrong\". It is not fair to disregard a question when the student doesn\u2019t even understand how to ask let alone what to ask. Lastly, just know that Rainbolt hates teaching gen chem, he will tell you that if you ever get a good conversation going with him. If you are looking for a passionate GEN CHEM class, take a different professor. It's one thing to hate teaching gen chem, however as the recipient student this SUCKED. I felt he did not care about the gen chem class especially because we did not even have lecture material and his neglect showed. \r\n\r\nI want to reiterate that this is all how I PERSONALLY FELT. Take this review with a grain of salt and make your OWN assumptions. As I mentioned I am a senior, I've had over 40-50 different professors at this university and rarely write an actual review for them, which shows I am definitely somewhat fed up. HOWEVER!!!! If you are stuck with rainbolt, it's not the end of the world!!! you will pass if you put in the effort, you cannot slack off or skip lectures. \r\n\r\nYou will be frustrated at the class the entire semester, but you will pass and get through it.", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "C", "created": "2023-12-13T03:03:43.299377Z"}, {"professor": "Ashley Baxter", "course": "CHEM131", "review": "Dr. Baxter is a great professor but chem is going to be difficult no matter what.

I never enjoyed chemistry in high school, so I can't say I was anticipating this course. \r\n\r\nWith that said, overall, Dr. Baxter was a great professor. Let's talk about lectures. \r\nI know some people say that she lectures too quickly, but isn't that the case with all college semesters? While Dr. Baxter finished topics in about a week or two, she always paused for questions after each sub-topic during lectures. She's friendly, and understanding and will repeat concepts even if she repeated them already. In addition, she had office hours throughout the week for additional help on homework or questions. She also replies to emails quickly. \r\nI would recommend printing out the lecture guided notes (super helpful in reviewing) and filling them out throughout lecture periods. \r\n\r\nWith homework, we only had around one per week, which consisted around 30 - sometimes 60 questions that take 2-3 hours, depending on the topic. Now this same seem like a lot, but it's not so bad if you split questions in different sittings throughout the week. I liked to finish them around a week in advance to get a head start on the next topic. Don't try to leave it last minute! Even though they may not support grades as much, they're an excellent source of review and help for exams. \r\n\r\nAlright, exams...\r\nDr. Baxter has 4 exams total for Gen Chem: 3 mid-terms and 1 final. For all the exams, she provides information and the format around a week before and sometimes pops in a hint or two of what to expect. \r\n\r\nNow, all the exams had pretty low-class averages in the 60s, which I never experienced in high school. However, the exams are fair and doable. I mean each exam had multiple students getting As and even A+s. \r\n\r\nDr. Baxter also has a policy that your final exam will replace your lowest midterm score, which often helps a lot for most students. For instance, if you bomb the first exam, you still have a chance. However, you will need to work hard to succeed in this course. My best advice would be to practice, practice, practice. The more questions and problems you do, the easier it will be to recognize concepts on the exams. Review the guided notes, homework, discussion worksheets, and GSS worksheets. I never liked a textbook, so I didn't use it. But if that works for you, you can use that too for more problems. \r\n\r\nThe final was pretty long and brain-frying, but it was fair. Try limiting dumb mistakes, and don't overthink lol. For this recent final, Dr. Baxter even included some questions we did in lecture, which was super helpful. In addition, if you collected all your previous midterm exams, you got 3 free bonus points, which was great. \r\n\r\nIf you're still worried, well, this may ease some nerves. Baxter has a really generous curve at the end of the semester, which can literally bump your grade by a whole letter.

Since her lectures are super early, it can be easy to skip but I recommend going to every lecture to retain the information and learn how to solve the practice problems on her lecture slides. The exams are pretty fair but the long answer questions can be difficult but as long as you do the GSS worksheets, lecture slide problems, and discussion worksheets: it's basically like the exam. The homework assignments were very tedious and took a few hours so chunk it up over the course of a few days. Baxter was sassy and if you asked \"dumb\" questions, she would have a little attitude behind her response. Her curve was pretty nice, being around 10% but that is the average for most science classes. Also, she provides extra points for the final if you collect all of your exams which was nice. She's an okay professor, just put in the work early in the semester so you don't have to play catch up because the final exam was pretty difficult.", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "B-", "created": "2024-01-12T17:28:38.580109Z"}, {"professor": "Lenea Stocker", "course": "CHEM131", "review": "CHEM131 with Dr Stocker was not that bad of a class.

She posts the slides but not the notes online so if you want the notes you have to go to class or get them from someone else.  But going to class is helpful since exam problems are similar to ones she goes over in class.  \r\n \r\nGrading structure is 3 midterms (100pts each), final (200pts), and 11 HW (10x10pts she drops the lowest).

I was a little nervous, but after taking this course with Dr. Baxter, it went better than expected. \r\n\r\nI thought Dr. Baxter lectured well, for the most part. Yes, she does cover a lot, so you have to attend EVERY lecture, or you will fall behind. But that's pretty much the case for all college courses; all of them are fast-paced. Don't bother making your own notes because Dr. Baxter already gives you lecture-based guided notes, which are super helpful for review. Sometimes, it can be hard to follow, but Dr. Baxter always pauses for questions after every mini-topic or practice question. She'll even re-explain a concept if you just ask. You can also ask her questions or express concerns before the lecture or during office hours. Always ASK if you're confused about something. That's literally what professors are there for. \r\n\r\nFor homework, I suggest starting it early and breaking it into chunks. Depending on the topic, there can be 30 - 60 questions with conceptual or math problems. Do a few problems every day, and try to finish a few days or even a week before the deadline, so you have enough time to review it again for exams. Even though it's not worth much, homework is going to be one of your primary study resources because the problems tend to be a bit harder than on the exams. \r\n\r\nAlright, everyone's favorite: exams. Dr. Baxter has three mid-terms and one final with MCQs, Short-response, and Long response questions. Around a week before the exam, she provides some info about the exam and might pop in a hint or two. The exams were a bit difficult for most people, and the class average for all of them didn't get past a high 60, which is the lowest I've ever seen, to be honest. However, they are doable, and some students did get A+s. The number one strategy is practice, practice, practice. The more practice problems you do (discussion WS, GSS, etc.), the easier it will be for you to recognize a question and solve it quickly. Some students, if not most, couldn't even finish the whole exam because of time. But, the exams are worth like 85% of your grade - which is A LOT - so you have to do your best. If you don't know a question, put something on the paper even if it's rubbish. You can expect to at least gain a few points because TAs tend to grade with tenancy. \r\n\r\nThe final was long and brain-frying but overall fair. Some questions even came from the lecture, which was great. After the exam, Dr. Baxter also gives you three free points if you collect all your previous exams. In addition, she'll replace your lowest midterm score with the final if it benefits you, which helped a lot of students. \r\n\r\nDoes this class have a curve? Yes, and it's a fat one: 10%. She literally bumps your grade by a letter if the class average is in the 60s. \r\n\r\nA final word. Overall, even though I never liked chemistry, taking this course with Dr. Baxter made it tolerable and sometimes even fun. She's really understanding, will try to help out in any way she can, and wants her students to succeed. But you'll have to reach out and care about your performance. \r\n\r\nThis class won't be a breeze, and you can't really expect it to be, but, in the end, you'll have to be willing to put the effort and time into this course if you want to get an A. \r\n\r\nHope this helped, and good luck.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2024-01-21T19:55:44.466520Z"}, {"professor": "James Rainbolt", "course": "CHEM131", "review": "I haven't talked to anyone with other professors and how they are, but I did very well in his class and I honestly don't think he is an absolute lunatic who will eat you whole like many else described him as. One key trait of Rainbolt's teaching style is that offers these \"module\" packets, these packets have everything you need to learn about the topic and he goes over them in lectures. When you don't understand something and go to ask him about it, he will tell you to look at the modules, and most times he would be right, what you will need to know in this class is all printed on his modules, and he does a pretty good job at writing them, however, it is still very frustrating to be dismissed by him saying \"you probably didn't look at the modules\". There are also many practice questions on the modules and if you can finish those questions by yourself it means you have understood the concept.
