The professor is very passionate about what she is teaching and I can honestly say that the material and readings were interesting. However, this is not an easy A. I got a B+ in the class. Granted, I didn't read half of the books, but even when I did read, the quizzes were very difficult. Also, the final is cumulative and it's like impossible to remember everything that happened in every story that we read over the course of the semester. And yes, this is a literature class, so there was a lot of assigned reading. But to end on a good note, the stories that I did read, I highly enjoyed.
