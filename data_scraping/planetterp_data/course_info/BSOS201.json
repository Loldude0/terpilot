Do not be scared off by some of the recent negative reviews. The fact is that this class isn't for everyone, but if you are interested in the topics then it will be the best class you'll take at UMD (it has been for me). The first half of the semester is intense and requires reading a few books. There are weekly quizzes used to encourage you to stay on track but they aren't weighted high for the overall grade. I hate to read and stress about quizzes, but being interested in the topics makes it pretty enjoyable and the quizzes aren't too bad. \r\n\r\nPeople complain about the workload during the start of the class, but it's really not that bad and only having class once a week means you can space out the work. It is by no means easy for the first part of the class, but if you manage your time then it's fine. After the midterm, the weekly quizzes stop and the class goes into cruise control basically. You'll be in a virtual trading competition that you'll need to monitor every few days, but if you put in the work during the start of the class it is pretty easy. \r\n\r\nThe final project makes up a very high percentage of your grade. If you pay attention the whole year, the project shouldn't be bad at all. It takes a lot of time and detail to put together, so you'll need to give yourself a lot of time to do it. But in terms of difficulty, it isn't too hard at all (if you pay attention and try throughout the semester). The way the grades work, you won't have access to your grade on elms throughout the semester. They do this because your grades are calculated using excel and it makes it easier to play with the final weighting and stuff. If the grade was visible in elms throughout the semester, it might give students a false sense of their performance in the class. If you want to know your general grade and how your doing, you can just go to the virtual office hours and ask a Teacher's Assistant. Dr. Wish usually says that almost no students ever fail his class.\r\n\r\nYou'll also see some people complaining about technical analysis in these reviews. Even if you never plan to use technical analysis or Dr. Wish's trading strategies, this class is till very valuable.

This is also NOT a class about financial literacy.\r\n\r\nI took this class because I thought I would learn how stocks work, what can make them move up or down, and some general knowledge on how to manage my money. I got none of that. I still have no idea what makes a stock move up or down other than \"uhhh someone out there thinks this company is good maybe\". And we learned one and only one thing about financial literacy, which I'll tell you right now: get a Roth IRA, it's better than a traditional IRA.\r\nThe first half of the class was learning the alien language of Technical Analysis. From everyone I've talked to outside this class who knows what they're doing, TA is considered absolute garbage. You'll learn about \"indicators\" for the stock movement that are pretty much arbitrary and often even contradict each other (e.g. MACD histogram and stochastics have a strong correlation, but tell you opposite things). Of course, when you put these into practice, stocks turn out to be largely random noise. I'd go on here, but I'm no expert in the stock market, and others can say this better (including some of the reviews here, especially that one really long one). At roughly the halfway point of the course, you'll take a big midterm. That was fairly standard, but it took me way longer than I was expecting.\r\nThe second half is a trading simulation where you get $100,000 in fake money and have to invest it. I ended up with a ~1.7% profit, in a pretty bad market. This is a cute idea on paper, but in reality it just creates a ton of extra work and eats up your free time, including thanksgiving break. It's also really restrictive; the idea is to trade for yourself to see what it's like, but every stock you buy has to follow some strict rules (which I didn't even realize I broke multiple times), and every stock needs a \"setup\", which is even more restrictive. You're supposed to learn about trading from the simulation, but all I learned was that stocks are mostly random noise. You have to trade quite a bit, and the final has you analyzing every single trade you made. It's just tedious for no reason. The one thing I will give to him is that he's clear about grading. He tells you pretty much exactly what you need to do to get an A, meaning you don't have to think much... so it's not only busywork but MINDLESS busywork!! Also the final paper is worth 65% of your grade which is just horrendous.\r\nOther notes: the gender ratio is really bad. Like, CS class bad. There are 10 TAs and 2 professors and none of them know me. The classroom is huge, and you can clearly see more and more empty chairs as the class goes on. In the first week or so, he'll go the entire way through the 3 hours with no break to scare people off, but after that he'll typically have a 10 minute break in the middle-- which is still nowhere near enough to sit through a 3 hour lecture. If you get top 10 or bottom 10 in the simulation he'll make you talk in front of the class, so maybe don't do that.

The course itself is not quite fun nor teaches much content and may be difficult to achieve a high grade in.\r\n\r\nOnwards to the full review!\r\nBecause of the sheer conflicting amts of 1 and 5 star ratings I'll be going very very indepth here and review in form of Q&A. Read other reviews before this one. Simply put they're both right\r\n\r\nQ: Is the workload for this course actually bad? Who is right?\r\nA: The ones who say it's crazy are right to an extent. Those saying it's not bad are flat out lying for the first few weeks. Some of your first quizzes have assigned readings of 50-200 pages and like 30 minutes of videos in addition to lecture content. Luckily you can get away with a B or A on these quizzes through good use of cntrl F, google, and youtube video -> transcript conversions. However the fact that you're expected to dedicate this amount of work initially? Crazy. Luckily these quizzes fall off in difficulty over time and halfway through the course cease to exist, from which case effort is smooth sailing until your final paper. You have a trading simulation instead which you are supposed to actively manage, but if you plan it out and know in advance what you need to do you can realistically only put in effort trading a few stocks and still be fine by the end. The two week add drop will expose you to these quizzes, so if you think they're manageable then this course is easy from then on.\r\n\r\nQ: Are the 3 hour lectures bad? Is it impossible to set through?\r\nA: Nah but man does this class not need to be 3 hours. The first hour might be taken up by relatively slow review over quizzes, some what rambly analysis of new market events, or other things. Simply put it's not very organized and the content could be easily delivered in 2 hours or less. The end of this course has frequent guest speakers as there is no more content in this course left, so while this might be a pro or con I found some of these speakers quite boring. Impossible to sit through? Certainly not, but lecture 100% does not need to be 3 hours. They're all recorded and you can totally skip so you can play them back at 2x speed. (My recommendation)\r\n\r\nQ: Is the class content actually useful? Is TA astrology?\r\nA: Yes-ish, Yes-ish. If you have 0 financial background or 0 stock backgrounds then this course will intro you to some basic ideas that can be useful as a catalyst for your own further personal research. If you have previous experience not much in this course will be new info for you. Despite being 14 weeks long surprisingly little content is discussed in the 3 hour lectures. I personally am not a fan of TA and thus didn't take away much from the course itself, but having to work with stocks and research so often catalyzed my own interest and passion which I think was a net plus. Thus the course itself? Not very useful, but for newbies it can be an ok launchpad.\r\n\r\nQ: General biggest cons?\r\nA: Dr. Wish makes TA sound like the second coming of christ. In reality TA is a mixed bag that doesn't have crazy proved performance. Don't get trapped by this and make sure to do your own personal research for alternative trading methods. \r\nA: Grades are LOCKED and you cannot view your own grade in calculus and thus have to do the math for it or beg a TA to view it. Annoying as all hell and frankly am not sure why they do this. \r\nA: Trading simulation has assigned busywork (and quizzes). In reality you will learn what you can skimp and not do and get away with to have a more manageable schedule, but before that workload is high.\r\nA: Grading is brutal, but there always are rubrics. Despite this you can feel like you followed the rubric and still lose points because different TA's are very different in grading style and rigor. Go to office hours and complain your case and you just might get points back on certain assignments (When applicable, most things you cannot change your grade like this. Realistically only one assignment you can) \r\n\r\nAnd to end it off on a positive note here's why despite all that I give it a 4 stars. It's just a good way to immerse yourself in stocks and to socialize with other people who are interested. The actual class itself? Mid. The experience? Good.  If you actually want to learn deep thoughtful content on stocks, learn it yourself and you will learn it better and faster. This class however introduced me to some great people and just sparked my interest so I'm biased with personal experiences to like it. I think in reality though the haters are right and this class is outdated and badly organized. \r\nThis class is certainly not the easiest A, nor may it be enjoyable for some of you.
