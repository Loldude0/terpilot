I know this looks like a long review but PLEASE READ AND DO NOT TAKE THIS LIGHTLY.\n\r\nI should have taken my roommate's advice more seriously: He had Nadler when she began teaching 107 sections last Spring semester, and according to my roommate, she TOLD his class, \"I WAS ASSIGNED TO BEGIN TEACHING COMM 107 TO LOWER THE OVERALL GPA FOR THIS COURSE.\" I could not believe him at first, but as it turns out, he (and she) were right. There are 2 people in my class who have A- 's and one who has an A. The rest of the students' grades range from B to F. That just should not happen in an INTRODUCTORY LEVEL, GENERAL EDUCATION COURSE. In speaking with friends who took the same course this semester, I have heard that almost everyone in every class has an A or a B. \n\r\nAs said from previous reviewers, she plays favorites LIKE YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE. I actually thought I was one of her favorites, but that seemed to change about midway through the semester as I started getting more and more points taken off of my assignments and speeches. Your skills are supposed to improve in this class, not degrade! It did not help having her at 8am three days each week, as she marked me off for coming in only 5 minutes late...and did not care about student who slept in. She does give you 3 free absences as per dept standards, but as it was my only 8am class, these 3 freebies evaporated all too quickly for me--and every class you miss after the first 3 basically removes from a half to a whole PERCENT off of your grade. Course is comprised of 200 points, and the participation grade is like 15 points or something like that. Every bit you miss will hurt you. NADLER LIKE TO NIT PICK ON EVERYTHING, BE AWARE.  \n\r\nShe is a terrible lecturer, and will start the year by going through the chapter assigned for that day's reading  and then will progressively cover less and less information than is on the exams. I received a 100, an 88, and a 55 on Exams 1, 2, and 3, respectively. For the main presentations, I received a 4.5/5, a 25/30, a 24/30, and then a 32/41 on the final. Did I become a worse student? I really doubt that.... given that I am in the Engineering school and got straight A's in all my other classes, and I also gave a most memorable speech at my High School graduation. \n\r\nIf you think you are a good public speaker, you are probably right. Don't let this woman's class tell you otherwise. Take anyone else and you should get a solid A just by showing up and trying your best. BUT NOT HERE. DROP IF POSSIBLE.

And on top of these unclear instructions, she still grades very harshly and hardly even mentions what you did wrong. If you ask her why something was graded the way it was, you will be lucky to get a proper response. She acts as if she is above everyone in the room, as if she has this aura where everyone will look up to her. And if she is running short on time, it doesn't matter if you worked your ass off on an assignment, or if you spent 3 seconds on it, you'll get the same grade.

And if something in her class isn\u2019t working well for you, chances are she\u2019d be happy to help you figure out another way to approach it.

There are a lot of presentations we have to do, but Kalin does everything she can to help students have end products they are content with. She provides students with a lot of resources and places emphasis on preparation.

He really creates a welcoming and safe environment which can be important as the class can be daunting to some. Grading wise, he is A VERY SLOW grader but very lenient (literally never actually graded any presentations just put a final grade into testudo even though he continuously said the grades would be inputted into canvas soon). I would highly recommend him as a professor as he understands that most don't want to take the class but are instead required to which makes him lenient to grading as long as you are actively participating in the class consistently.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-12-25T00:15:29.149232Z"}, {"professor": "Daviana Fraser", "course": "COMM107", "review": "She is a great comm professor who can connect to the students very well since she is young and understanding.

Yes, she sometimes did talk about other stuff (like her ex-husband, lol), but I think she does that to connect with the class a little more and alleviate the tension of a new professor a bit. Everyone likes a professor with even a small sense of humor. However, as a professor, she spoke clearly, and at least for me, I could tell she was a decent communications professor. She even discussed one-on-one at selected times during class with different groups on their outlines and presentation slides. \r\nWith only a few weeks left, she graded our last two presentations with leniency and gave constructive feedback.
