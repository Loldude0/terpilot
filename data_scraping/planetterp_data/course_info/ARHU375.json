I have absolutely nothing bad to say about him or this class. I highly recommend taking this class if you are interested in scriptwriting. Best class decision I have made. He is very understanding and supports creativity in his class. If you have the opportunity to take any class with him, DO IT. I have never met a teacher who actually understands how to TEACH, and do so in a way that drives students to retain and want to learn information. This class felt like a breath of fresh air in a sea of stress. I could go on and on about my experience but I will my ranting here. Thank You Mr. Cote.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2022-12-09T05:17:06.275517Z"}], "department": "ARHU", "course_number": "375", "name": "ARHU375", "title": "The TV Writers Room Screenwriting for Television and Video", "credits": 3, "description": "<b>Prerequisite:</b> ARHU275, ARHU318, or FILM370; and permission of instructor.\n<b>Additional information:</b> Priority in enrollment will be given to students participating in the Jimenez-Porter Writers' House and FILM studies programs.\nStudents engage with the theory and practice of screenwriting for television and video.
