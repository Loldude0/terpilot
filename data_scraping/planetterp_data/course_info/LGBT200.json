There are frequent daily questions, which are not too bad to complete (about a paragraph each). I found that she is a very lenient and easy grader, and accommodates situations as they arise. The class is not too demanding or difficult, but does require frequent readings (for those that may be unaccustomed to that). There are frequent videos and films that are also assigned, which helps add variety. There was a class emergency at one point, and she engaged and handled the incident expertly and with a profound kindness.
