Her grading policies feel very unclear, and the course project is all over the place. Long story short the project has people partnered with others from a specific program, however roughly a third of the class didn't get a partner. She isn't doing anything about it and is just telling the students to find a solution that doesn't exist. It's a very confusing class. She becomes easily frustrated with students who don't solve the problems attached to the project she created. It meets for three hours a week, which is a long session as is, but the amount of additional work outside of class is ridiculous for a GenEd. Additionally, the activities in class are very repetitive and show that the professor doesn't put a lot of effort into them.", "rating": 2, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2024-03-08T04:12:15.280303Z"}], "department": "TLPL", "course_number": "443", "name": "TLPL443", "title": "Understanding Cross-Cultural Communication for Teaching English Language Learners", "credits": 3, "description": "<b>Credit only granted for:</b> EDCI436 or TLPL443.\n<b>Formerly:</b> EDCI436.\nTheories of intercultural communication and techniques for applying them in the teaching of English as a second language (ESL) and content classes.
