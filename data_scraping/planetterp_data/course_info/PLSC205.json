Students that expect the easy A and don't want to show up will obviously fail. This is a 4 credit lab that I took to satisfy my Natural Science Lab credit. While professor Carroll is a good and understanding professor, the course material is quite intense and rigorous. Despite few students, even ones in the major struggled. The material is very dense, but you learn a lot. Overall this is not the worst gen ed lab, and Dr. Carroll does his best. Show up to class and he will show up for you.", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "A-", "created": "2022-12-21T02:42:20.344060Z"}], "department": "PLSC", "course_number": "205", "name": "PLSC205", "title": "Introduction to Turf Science and Management", "credits": 4, "description": "<b>Credit only granted for:</b> PLSC205 or PLSC305.\n<b>Formerly:</b> PLSC305.\nPrincipals of turf science and culture with emphasis on turfgrass anatomy, morphology, and physiology.
