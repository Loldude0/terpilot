Primarily, his grading, or lack of it- he still hasn\u2019t graded assignments due in February, so I don\u2019t actually know what my grade in the class is. Second of all, he has had some issues releasing assignments, assigning them to the right due dates, etc. \r\nFor example, about halfway through the first half of the class (the class is split into a \u201ccrash course about lots of things\u201d and then \u201cwork on massive group project\u201d), he pushed all our homework back by half a week. Except all the homework\u2019s were still due in Elms the same time his posted schedule had them due, both of which were wrong, and had you panicking to do homework we had not been taught how to do yet.\r\nAlthough I will say I know Mike really worked hard to simplify a lot of the homeworks, which I am also really grateful for.\r\nAnother downside is that sometimes when you get to the team project part, you can ask him a question, and he\u2019ll just answer something that is not in relation to your question/fixing the opposite of your problem/checking something you\u2019ve already checked but ignoring you when you say you\u2019ve checked it, etc.\r\n\r\nHowever, in terms of the class itself, the class SUCKS. Mike makes it as good as he can, but the class is a massive time suck (easily 12+ hours on average, occasionally getting to 15+ a week). There\u2019s \u201copen lab\u201d hours which are the only times outside of class you can work on your project, but if they\u2019re during class, oh well. I have skipped class, I dropped all my clubs, and significantly dropped my social life. And yet most of my team was actually helpful. I can\u2019t imagine getting a bad team. I still haven\u2019t started studying for any of my exams because I have spent about 20 hours on the project in the past week. If you can avoid this class, DO NOT TAKE IT!!! You get lots of \u201clearning experience\u201d but it only matters if you\u2019re an engineering student (ignoring that the project has little/no correlation with majors like bioengineering, chemical engineering, etc).

First off, I am so puzzled by his high review. This was his first ever time teaching this course, and It absolutely shows. This class isn't like most, it's a really big group project lab-based course, and Aris had absolutely 0 idea what he was doing. Firstly, he provided 0 help on anything that wasn't related to mechanics, which sucks because the hardest part of this class is using Arduino, wiring and coding. Anytime I would ask him for help he would reply with \"I'm not sure ask a UTF\" which meant our professor was non existent and simply was in class getting paid to ruin the lives of prospective engineers.\r\n\r\nThe worst thing: the grading. Oh. My God. The. Grading. It is absolutely horrendous. The group project in this class is essentially meant to be a failure due to it being an intro course, and it being weighed only 15 points. The instructors expect you to have 0 idea on what you're doing, but they compensate for this by having a lot of other easy assignments that are free points and worth a lot more. Not with Aris, absolutely not with Aris. He will dock off points for the most obscure things, even on the easy assignments, just to take off points. There were numerous milestones that were worth 80 points each, and I had lots of friends who received 75+ on them, but in our class, the average was a 64. This was a common trend among every singly assignment we had. He would contradict his own directions. For instance, he told us to have tons of ideas in place for our robot to show that we were brainstorming, but when we presented all of our ideas, he tells us that we need to finalize a design. like WTF. He also goes out of his way to change the rules. for one the milestones, we literally proved that our robot could do one of the tasks but he would not give us credit for it because the way we did it was too \"simple\". Is the point of engineering not to work smart, not hard? He also never explains what he takes off points for. on the rubric, he will simply right \"good\" or \"ok\" and then give us a 8/10 or something. This class is meant to be an easy A, but my group and I, we have never devoted so much time on a class and put in so much effort just to get absolutely pummeled by an old man from Cyprus. \r\n\r\nHe is a nice guy at heart, and I am guessing that in a lecture-based class he is a great professor, but he is absolutely atrocious in this class and I have never disliked a class so much. I never recommend him and if you are in his class for ENES100, I pray you have a good team.\r\n\r\nOur TF, Maguire Ballard, was an absolute goat. He would always be on our side and it was so obvious him and Aris were not on the same page. Our TF has been a ta for this class for 3 semesters, so he actually knew what he was doing.

The course is designed to be pretty generous (ie you can still pass the class even if your robot epically fails) but you will get out of the class what you put in. There are a lot of opportunities to learn new skills such as 3-D printing and laser cutting as long as you are willing to put yourself out there.
