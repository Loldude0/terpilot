Some of the content is interesting and enjoyable, other parts of it are tedious and annoying to solve without the IPA. Overall it isn't the worst if you put in a good amount of effort. \r\n\r\nProfessor Bleam is a good professor, it's the course content which i have a problem with. I expected the content to be solely focused on the theoretical and philosophical side of linguistics. It turns out this class was largely dominated by the International Phonetic alphabet and the scientific and technical side of linguistics. This was annoying because it takes a good amount of extra time to try to understand these concepts in addition to memorizing the IPA, which is something they required us to do. The memorization aspect really was just extra work as we could have grasped the concepts without struggling through the memorization. I went to almost every discussion section and lecture and i still found it so tedious to have to learn how to do the exercises. The topic isn't hard and I basically got the hang of it by the final, but the content/exercises were made unnecessarily hard by the memorization. Doing the out of class readings doesn't explain a whole lot either. You need to go to office hours and do some practice to understand. With this i will say that the homework assignments did help. My discussion section on the other hand was largely a waste of time. If they had provided us with a sheet detailing the IPA on tests, then the class average would have been much higher and in my personal experience I would have understood how to do the practice exercises better and much earlier on in the course.

She's been doing this for a while and knows her stuff. Takes everything really slow, class was extremely easy for me and homework served as a nice chill break from other heavy coursework. Exams were super fair, discussions were good, content was interesting and well-paced. Workloads weren't bad, one assignment per week that takes about an hour. Uses clickers in class but most of the time, you get full credit for clicker questions regardless of what you pick; it's just for participation.

The TAs were grad students in Linguistics and were really helpful. \r\nNow, I will say that this class is not really a \"history\" class and is somewhere between a humanities class and a math class. Most of the semester is spent on the technical side of linguistics, looking at how sounds and words and sentences are internally structured and forming these systematic rules for language. For me, being used to this type of thinking in CS, it was fine. But I can see how it would be hard for some people who may not be as used to such technical coursework.\r\nI will also say that this class probably is a little too much for a GenEd and there are easier GenEds for DSHS.
