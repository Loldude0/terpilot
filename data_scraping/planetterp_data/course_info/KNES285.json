Dr. Jette herself is very helpful, passionate about the topic, and approachable, but the TA's are the one who grade the written assignments so most of the time I went to him, even though he is not very helpful.

However some assignments near the end of the semester are incredibly time consuming. There is no final exam but the final paper is worth 30% of your grade.

Office hours are kinda useless. I went with an annotated document with specific questions about my analysis (he claimed it was never thorough enough) and he refused to read any portion of my paper, insisting I read it to him or come with \"more specific questions\". He emphasizes \"quality over quantity\" but he clearly doesn't understand what quality is. I understand that this is his first time being a TA for a lecture course (vs an activity course), but this TA does not know how to engage with students, communicate in coherent and full sentences in response to students questions without reading from a powerpoint slide, and is not easily approachable. He stated at the beginning of the year that he's \"afraid of angry emails so please don't send them.\" I think he lacks confidence in his abilities, which I do sympathize with and recognize that he's putting himself out there, however he is detrimental to students performance and understanding of the course.

Love Dr. Jette, 5/5 professor!! Great style of teaching, always willing to help bc SHE CARES, gives GREAT FEEDBACK on papers & listens to student criticism- however, overall class experience is 3/5. While the content is interesting & lectures enjoyable... the workload is very time consuming so plan accordingly- stressed me out more than Biomechanics. The weekly quizzes are not hard. It's literally open note so pull up the lecture slides while taking the quiz- answers are in the slides. The only thing that won\u2019t be is the 2 assigned articles you\u2019re given but majority of the time she talks about em in class so if ya pay attention can make an educated guess. Got a 100% on almost all. As far as the CHIL\u2019s they are graded harsh & ur grade depends on who you get as a TA. Won't say names but depending on ur TA all I can do is pray for you\u2026 go on bow ya head. Mine was mostly unhelpful, made me cry/feel stupid, and when asked why something was wrong usually gave an abstract answer that didn\u2019t make sense. Spoken with multiple people who all (which is crazzzy) verbatim said \u201cI feel like no matter what I do it won\u2019t be good enough\u201d- that's a problem. So GO TO DR. JETTE FOR THE CHILS. You have 4 CHILS & use them to build your final paper. Go over the content/main points you want to discuss & make sure you understand WHAT you should be talking about (a lot of people get points off bc they aren\u2019t answering the prompts correctly). Go over that outline with Dr. Jette or your TA (if they\u2019re good), draft your paper, send it to ur TA to receive feedback, edit the paper accordingly, then if you're a religious person\u2026 pray. If you're still unhappy with the grade dispute it & Dr. Jette will grade it herself. If all else fails ur given 2 extra credit opportunities, each for a chance to raise your grade by 1%.

Physical culture refers to a broad range of movement practices including sport, play, rehabilitative exercise, health and fitness training, and recreation and leisure. More specifically, we challenge the idea that historical physical culture practices--and the scientific processes from which they were derived--were 'neutral' or 'objective'; rather, we explore the cultural, social, political, and economic contexts shaping physical culture knowledge, study, structures, and policies across American history. The goal is for you to learn and apply techniques of historical analysis to develop a critical understanding of how knowledge about, and practices of, physical culture supported a particular social order via the construction of difference, norms, and/or hierarchies, and ultimately contributed to some of the inequalities that endure today.", "is_recent": true, "geneds": null}
