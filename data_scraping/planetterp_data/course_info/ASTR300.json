Exams will also be entirely Pearson questions.  I struggle to think of a single thing in this class the teacher has done himself.  Grading?  We are just over two months in and we have gotten ONE homework back.\r\n\r\nAll the Pearson questions make the class very easy, but this class has been the perfect example of how to teach one of the most exciting topics in the most boring way imaginable.

First of all the class material isnt that bad, but I think the professor just did a bad job at teaching (that is if u want to call what he did over the semester \"teaching\" because quite frankly its not). \r\nI am a senior CS student doing my ULC in Astronomy, this was my last ASTR class and it was definitely the worse out of the 4 I took by far. \r\nThis guy thinks he is the Sun and the world revolves around him and as if students have nothing to do but work on his class. 13 Mastering HWs that take a minimum 90 minutes each to complete, in addition to 8 written HWs that take a minimum of 3 hours each. All that wasnt enough for Prof. Sun! There was two midterms each having more than 35  questions and a final that was about the same. You'd think that is it? But no, this guy will never fail to surprise you! There were graded lecture quizzes every class that were worth 10% of out total grade. \r\nI was taking CMSC4XX classes and I honestly had a harder time in this class than all other combined. This class was said to be for NON-SCIENCE majors, but bro was talking about quantam physics through the semester. It honestly amazes me how UMD allows such a class to exist. \r\nOther than that, the  professor in class whispers rather than speaks, and all was done is slides from pearson that we could read from home, but he didnt give us access to them until mid-semester ish. He is also rude to students, he doesnt like students to use their phones during class and will ask you not to in a rude way. One time a student was using their phone and had their airpods on, so he asked  him or her  to put it down but the person wasnt hearing him, so what he did is he started banging on the table. \r\nGrading takes forever, 5 out of the 8 written hws were graded after the final was taken in a week.\r\n\r\nI think this might be his first time teaching, because I couldnt find reviews about him at the start of the semester. \r\nIf this class is offered again with a diff professor, give it a try.
