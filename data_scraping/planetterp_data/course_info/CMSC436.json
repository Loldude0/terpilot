He is frequently absent to nonexistent on the student forum Piazza, and many questions are left unanswered or answered only affer they aren\u2019t relevant anymore (i.e. exam/project questions after the deadline). A couple examples:\r\n\r\n1. For our midterm we were learning stuff up to the week before the exam. Porter confirmed that the exam material may include what was taught in lecture that week, but neglected to upload the slides for that material. Many students asked on the forum for the slides, frequently (13 hours before the exam, 9 hours, then 5 and then 2 hours before the exam, all on the same thread). One hour before the exam the professor finally responds saying \u201cSorry for the missing slides\u201d but still neglects to upload them\r\n\r\n2. On the Tuesday a week before Thanksgiving break Porter assigned us another lab, to be due the following Monday (2 days before break). Again, students posted on the forum asking for an extension on the lab due date as many people were traveling for break and as the lab was also longer and more difficult than any other. Once again, no response from the professor, even after over 30 people \u201cgood questioned\u201d it on Piazza. The day after, he assigned another lab due the Monday after break.\r\n\r\n3. The semester project was not brought up again until midterm season, and he waited an extra week to release the project idea bds, and then ANOTHER week to release the project signups (this wasn\u2019t intentional, he released them late), which left us about a month to start and finish a priject from scratch in addition to the weekly labs and our other classes.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, this class was a huge disappointment and made me reconsider never doing Android dev ever again. Other reviews say Porter grows bitter as more and more students stop going to class, but he also grows really unresponsive and irresponsible. He doesn\u2019t do a good job teaching; he just reads off the slides, which by themselves are just screenshots of sample code. Most of our labs we finished with a mix of stack overflow and just copying the sample code.", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2018-11-21T01:56:02Z"}, {"professor": "Adam Porter", "course": "CMSC436", "review": "Totally ineffective as a lecturer. He reads from the slides that are literally just text and bullet points. Lecturers are not engaging, and because the emulator on android studio is laggy and takes forever, he cannot demonstrate how apps work but instead shows you the code in fragments on his slide which are of no help.\r\n\r\nHis labs are relatively easy because they are \"fill in the blank\" style. These weekly labs were slightly annoying because they did not offer anything substantial to teach you. You could easily look up how to do something on stack overflow and it was normally a one liner. But I guess it is harder to make normal cs projects that involve making an application on android from scratch so personally I do not know what other alternative there could be.\r\n\r\nNow about the big group project: I feel this was managed horribly. The teams were not assigned until after the first midterm in mid October along with the potential project ideas to pick from if you didn't have an original one of your own. This left students 6 weeks to build an android application from scratch, while balancing weekly labs and other coursework. 6 weeks was not an adequate time frame to do a group project. You are normally a team of 6 people but thats still hard to manage during the roughest part of the semester.\r\n\r\nWhen it came to the midterm, students felt they got steam rolled. It was all short answer with a few true/false mixed in. the average was around a 64%. Fortunately the labs and the group project will weigh more than exams in the long run. Several students who took the midterm felt railroaded but that is partially due to Porters ineffective teaching.\r\n\r\nI learned the most about android dev doing my own outside research on youtube and stack overflow and most importantly during the group project. That is where the real learning starts. I understand this class will be switching over to iOS development for handhelds but whether or not that is a permanent thing or if it will alternate from fall to spring semester from android to iOS i am not sure. If Porter is teaching 436 again don't worry. The class is not too hard and its pretty manageable to get a high passing grade. Just don't expect much from Porter.

Several of my friends needed \"skills tests\" appointments (basically a live coding, open book quiz you take 1 on 1 with a prof or TA). He accomodated so many that I'm honestly surprised how he found all the time. Marsh also responds to piazza fairly quickly, for the majority of the semester. Marsh also provides hints in project descriptions about what concept to use to implement that part of the project. His projects are very fair. Not too easy, but not insanely difficult.
