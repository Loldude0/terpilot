That being said, I took BSCI160 with her in Fall 2020 and it was one of the worst classes I took that semester. The class was unfortunately asynchronous, and while I can't blame her for that decision, she did not adapt to the format well at all. For one thing, she did not have a syllabus, which was incredibly annoying, and instead had all material on her lecture schedule on ELMS. The problem with that is that this lecture schedule wasn't very well put together, it was incredibly disorganized and made it difficult to locate assignments sometimes. She would also sometimes post more than one lecture video for the day, exceeding the time that the class was originally meant to be. She hosted office hours during these originally scheduled class times, so you either had to watch her lectures before her office hours (and sometimes she wouldn't even upload the lectures until late in the afternoon) or hold onto your questions until the next time she had them. The lectures themselves were even more disorganized than her lecture schedule. They were not structured well and seemed to jump back and forth between broader topics and more specific topics. It's hard to truly explain how bad these lectures were, but it was very frustrating trying to take decent notes from them. The bulk of the assignments for her class were LAs (Learning Activities) and her worksheets. The LAs were super, super easy group assignments that were never an issue, and the worksheets were larger assignments that were probably better at teaching the subject than her lectures were. She didn't have any quizzes and would often have extra-credit activities that could get you a few additional points. She also technically assigned textbook reading, but since the textbook is an overall biology textbook, the readings would often go much more in depth than what was being taught in the lectures and didn't always line up that well; I stopped reading the textbook about a month in. The class had three midterms, with one being a week before the final exam. She drops one of the midterms and the final exam is optional, which was nice. Definitely study for the midterms! They were genuinely a little challenging. \r\n\r\nAgain, she definitely cares about her students and wants them to succeed. I somehow got an A in this class when I was bordering between a B+ and an A- for almost the entire semester, so it's not a difficult class to succeed in. But, if you're very \"Type A\" like me, this class might also prove to be pretty frustrating with how extremely disorganized it is.

I was expecting to take a different professor who had the highest ratings for this class and instead was stuck with Dr. Ngeve as a \"guest lecturer\". She is very hard to interpret as she doesn't understand what she's saying. Going to class doesn't help. Thank god our professor who we were supposed to have had recorded lectures because otherwise everyone would be failing the class. The numbers of people coming to class started getting lower day by day as people started realizing the lectures were online and were less time than the class itself. The one time people actually come to class is when we have our group \"activities\" which has nothing to do with the lecture. On these days the professor lectures for about 10 minutes and tells us to finish the lecture at home. Then she gets up and leaves before anyone can ask her any questions about whats going on in the class. Every week we have a 10 page assignment which is impossible to do. If we didn't have the previous professors lectures no one would be able to complete them. Any time Dr. Ngeve tries to engage the class by asking a question she gets nothing but blank stares across the room. Even the front sitters can't answer. When someone finally has the courage to raise their hand and attempt to answer she just responds by saying \"interesting thought, does anyone have another answer?\". Then when she finally says what the right answer is she doesn't explain why it's right and moves on. Also, don't bother asking any questions cause she won't have answers to them. During her lectures she skims through the slides, doesn't explain them, and still manages to not get through all of them. The exams are impossible to finish in time. We have 80 multiple choice on a scantron and and short answers on top of that. The graders are looking for exact wording from the slides and enjoy taking points off by missing a single word even if its synonymous. She gave us an exam 2 days before finals week. There's also no curve in the class and the averages for the tests are in the 60's.

Half the time she won't tell you ways to remember them but rather go on some completely unrelated and irrelevant tangent. If you ever wonder why communications is a gen ed requirement, the average Reaka lecture is your answer. You can get a rock fuckin solid 10 hours of sleep the night before one of her lectures and you will still nod off. Shit, she should stop being a professor and be an anethesiologist so she be paid for putting people to sleep on purpose.

You don't even have to be there for the first lecture because they. are. all. the. same.\r\n\r\nSo ok, she reads her powerpoints out loud. So what? Well, here's the kicker. In my last year of high school, I downloaded some of my textbooks because covid and whatnot. HER SLIDES FOR ONE TOPIC ARE BIGGER THAN A FUCKING TEXTBOOK. Now, to be fair, images take up more space than text, but look, on average, this shit is roughly 60 to 70 slides long. It takes multiple lectures to get through one topic. The individual slides look like shitposts for a biology meme group and are crammed with the skimmings of a wikipedia article. As for her tests, she will usually release a \"study guide\" a few days before the test. Your best bet is to study from the slides or the study guide by writing copious notes on whatever is mentioned.

She made our classroom experience so welcoming, and always encouraged and validated questions. Our lectures were mostly done via powerpoint, with participation questions (about 3-5) every class to review the information. I have seen some students mention her pacing as an issue, so if you struggle with writing and listening at the same time, you may benefit from taking notes on her lectures beforehand (the entire course is on ELMS from the first day, and every lecture has a powerpoint and recording, depending on what learning style you have). The thing I love most about Dr. Ngeve is that she gives her students as many opportunities as possible to take charge of their learning and improve their grades. She offers a lot of extra credit throughout the semester, usually in the form of learning activities and self-awareness reflections. While the class itself does not have a curve (aside from EC), my friends and I who regularly did extra credit often had over a 100% in the class. The exams can be challenging, but they often reuse participation and practice exam questions. Additionally, students are allowed a notecard in every midterm exam, and our final this year is open internet. A lot of doing well in this class is based upon demonstrated effort. Even if you do not do well on exams or homework (I have never gotten an A on any exams, and I usually don't get all of my homework assignments correct), it is still possible to do very well (I literally have over a 99 despite the stuff I mentioned earlier).

She provides 30 in-class participation points for doing the clickers, and you have a 5-class wiggle room (to my knowledge). She also has a VERY large amount of extra credit assignments for you to complete for points, 4 of these include LA worksheets which are meant to be completed and turned in with your prechosen LA group, which I found very annoying at times given I had a good group which a good response rate but I know people whose group did not attempt to do the worksheet as well and you were left to do it yourself for just 4 extra credit points. Aside from this, the homework assignments (We have 5 throughout the semester) were very helpful for studying for the exams. The exams are canvas protected and you are allowed one 3x5 notecard, I tended to squeeze a lot of information on the notecards as the exams would ask for specifics at times and the exams had (what I feel) a high volume of free response questions. Overall I had a C average on the three midterms that we had. I also really liked her canvas page and you can tell a lot of thought was put into it. The lecture schedule has a comprehensive list of all of the assignments expected for the semester and she does not stray much from it. She has all the lectures pre-recorded and posts all of the slides that were used in class, a downside to this is that if she does not finish going over slides in class she expects you to finish going over them outside of class to stay on track. There are also ULA reviews that the TAs host which are similar to GSS and these too are recorded and posted on Canvas. Lastly for our final, it is a canvas proctored open internet and open note final which truly takes the stress off of me with my other finals. While I will not say this class was an easy A because it is very easy to fall behind, with all the Extra credit and help she posts on the canvas page, you have to actively try to fail this class. With my C average on exams and the Extra credit, I currently have a 100.50 in this class.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-12-12T04:49:11.560380Z"}, {"professor": "Magdalene Ngeve", "course": "BSCI160", "review": "She is the most supportive teacher and she is always willing to help.

Passionate. Cares about students. The only negative is his lecture style. He is genuinely a boring person and talks very slow. The only way I could get through this class was \"recording\" his lectures and listening again some time later in 2x speed. His slides literally include no information-just some pictures and graphs without description. So you need to focus on what he says but since it is very difficult to stay focused during his lectures, recording helps. The worst part: his slides are not organized at all so you have to make connections between topics yourself. He wants you to focus on big ideas but that's why this class is challenging for most people. Without knowing the details, it's hard to understand the big picture. He did not explain the genetics unit well yet the questions on the midterms wanted us to know the details. So good luck with that unit especially. We only learned 1/4 of what the other class is learning and ran out of time at the end (the last few topics were rushed). But again, we can use cheat sheets for all 3 midterms & the final, and most questions on the final were taken from the past exams word for word. Lastly, his TAs were very helpful (although there weren't GSS sessions, they were welcoming during office hours and a lot of people showed up to do homework and ask questions).
