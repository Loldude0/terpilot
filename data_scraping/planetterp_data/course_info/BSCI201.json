Like a reviewer below me said -- she will shut you down REAL quick. She can get kind of mean if you question her in the slightest. \r\n2.She has some serious issues regarding body image. She makes some pretty awful jokes regarding skinny girls such as \"oh, well you'll get osteoporosis meanwhile us big boned girls wont.\" It really made me and the rest of the class uncomfortable-- considering most of the class was girls. \r\n3. Unless you're willing to sit through her ranting for 30 min, do NOT ask her about basic research. You've been warned. \n\r\nGrading/Lecture: \r\n1.She does not curve. Her class is out of 1000 points. With two exams and a final. (final is not cumulative.) She also has these \"summary sheets\" that are 30+ easy points. DO THESE.  \r\nHalf of the class points come from lab, which has a MASSIVE amount of information. Learn the diagrams by heart and use the power points given by the TA's during lab. \r\n3. She writes her notes on an overhead projector like in middle school. Her handwriting is AWFUL and she writes unbelievably fast. I would suggest either bringing a laptop or prepare to get wrist cramps. \r\n4. Her exams are fairly ok, if you went to class. They come straight from her notes. so no book necessary here. \r\n5. Her exams consist of multiple choice, T/F, short answer, and a matching that creates a phrase. \r\n5. She has tons of extra credit points! (hence no curve) \n\r\nStudy Tips:\r\nThis class has a lot of material and she will ask you on everything she talked about in class. She hates the book(even though she uses it) and usually has slides that are from the book just to say \"NOPE this is not the right thing. \" So, I would suggest going to class. This class is totally doable and not really that hard if you take the time necessary to look at her notes. She's nothing special, a 3/5. \n", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "A-", "created": "2015-07-06T15:16:00Z"}, {"professor": "Justicia Opoku-Edusei", "course": "BSCI201", "review": "OPOKU IS BAE. Literally this woman is a queen, and her outfits slay the game. On point every single class. Lecture exams aren't bad, just be on top of your stuff. I got A's on all of them. I think my lowest test grade was a 91 on the final. Yeah, so they're not hard, just study and you'll be fine hahah I don't understand how people were getting D's an F's on them when they're really not difficult as long as you prepared yourself. Overall, lecture is pretty good and it's a fun environment. Opoku likes to make jokes and talk about her kids and her life in general, so you always left lecture with a smile even if you were learning about atherosclerotic plaques or synchondroses or some other seemingly boring topic. \n\r\nLab, however, is a different story. I've gotten the general gist that with Opoku, Lecture is okay, and lab is awful, and with Lombardi it's the opposite. This is very true for Opoku, but not as bad as it seems. With lab, you just have to know a LOT more information for the practicals than you do for lecture exams. There are 4 practicals: tissues and cells, skin and bones, muscles, and the nervous system/senses + endocrine system. I got a 94, 83, 86, and 100, respectively. Know. Your. Shit. There is no way else that you'll be able to make it through. Your lab experience will also be defined by your TA. My TA was very sweet and lenient when appropriate. Instead of asking us to identify more challenging muscle origins/insertions like the brachioradialis or tensor fasciae latae, she'd give \"easier\" ones like....deltoid or gluteus maximus, that everyone knows haha. The first practical is a piece of cake. Once it gets to the skeletal/muscular practicals, the volume of information to know SKYROCKETS, but you can do it. Honestly, above all, this is a bio course, and ALL of biology is just memorization. So if you're good at that, this class isn't a problem. Also, don't forget to do the 7 online prelab quizzes. They're online and open note, and probably the easiest 70 points to earn in this 1000-point class. I think I ended up with a 56/70 cus I got 8/10 on a few and I forgot to do one before the deadline. But honestly, don't lose petty points on easy things like prelab quizzes. ALSO, she doesn't curve at the ended since literally 1/5 of every exam/assignment is extra credit. So if you're at a 89.999999% in the end, and your TA isn't nice, expect to get a B+. I had a 92.95% (which is an A-) and thank GOD my TA gave me a straight A, but some aren't so nice. \n\r\nOverall, you can get an A in this class if you put in the work. It's not that big of a commitment for a 4-credit course. And Opoku is the queen of everything, so that makes it 10x more enjoyable. I highly recommend taking this!

So if you don't have a problem with self-study, this is a super easy class. TBH all the bad reviews are probably bc their teaching style is more of a lecture type (nothing wrong with that) but with Opoku you need to take time to study and quiz yourself on the material and you will do fine. On my exams I got 89 to 95s and all I did was cram 4-3 days before (I don't recommend doing this) but all i would do is take notes from the powerpoint and use quizlet and thats it lol.\r\nAlthough I didn't have Lombardi I went to her lectures before I had to switch out and she does lecture really well BUT her exams are less memorization and more application (so I've heard) so if that's more of your style then you should probably take Lombardi.\r\n\r\nFor my Opoku gang, I was forced to take her bc of schedule conflicts and i was so upset abt it but I ended up really liking it just bc I find straight memorization easier than application. Literally everything on the exam will be straight from the powerpoints and its straight memorization. STRAIGHT MEMORIZAION. I promise. there's multiple choice, true/false, short answer, and matching (the letters form a sentence). As long as you get the gist of how some things relate to each other and how she words it on the powerpoints you will do fine. The class in general learned how her exams are formatted and the average went from a 60 to an 80. So if you start studying the first time and you will do fine on the first exam and get ahead of the class.\r\nLab wise it depends on the TA, mine would take half the lab time and she was really lenient with answers so unfortunately you cant really control that but overall the lab practicals are also straight memorization but you NEED to study. Just reviewing wont be enough. Its hard. I got 90s on all of mine but I also studied on quizlet throughout the week and tried to connect information together. If you can push yourself to study as much as you can and have some self-control to set aside time to study, you can probably get 80-90s on each practical. Its definitely not impossible.\r\nOverall, its an okay class but if you are not willing to put in the work, you're gonna end up regretting taking the class. Its doable I promise. I wish I could answer any questions you guys might have bc it was a rollercoaster for me and I wish I could help you guys more. But for now, you got this.
