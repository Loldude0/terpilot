The math involved in the homework gave some people problems, but overall it really was not that difficult if you could use the given equations and can convert units (high school level stuff).\n\r\nOverall: While I did enjoy the course a lot, it is \"designed primarily for non-science majors\" and therefore didn't go as in depth with physics as I personally would have liked.

Diemer would crack jokes, talk about current astro events, and made the course fun all around which made it enjoyable to go to each lecture, I wanted to go each day.
