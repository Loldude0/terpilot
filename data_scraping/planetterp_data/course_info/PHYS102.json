He tries to be chill and relatable which is at least kinda nice and he would bring out his guitar and give demonstrations when we were talking about music theory which was cool.

He would sometimes take some time to draw out diagrams on the chalkboards during lectures to explain certain concepts. It helps show dynamically how things change. The grading for assignments was very slow; at least a third of the assignments weren't graded until after the final. Since the course is also about music, he would bring his own instruments to the class sometimes to explain some of the concepts as well, which was helpful since I had zero knowledge about anything musical.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the course: The course was originally labelled as The Physics of Sound and Music, but it's currently labelled as The Physics of Music. So, the course is about both sound itself and music/instruments; but, the course is more heavily focused on the instrumental aspect. There were several TurningPoint participation grades that happened randomly throughout the lectures; so, we never really knew when they would happen. But, they were graded on completion rather than correctness. There were 3 exams total, including the final. The exams were pseudo-cumulative, in that you weren't tested directly on past material, but some of the later concepts were built off of previous concepts. There were 6 homework assignments that were online on ELMS. They were usually a mix of multiple choice, fill-in-the-blanks, and short answers. Some of the stuff on the homework were either never explained in lecture or weren't explained at all, which made it hard to get a good grade on some of the homework. There is a final group project that is given in the middle of the semester and due by the last day of classes. My semester's consisted of doing a presentation on a instrument of your group's choice (e.g., history, physics, etc.). However, it was a recorded presentation instead of having to present it in front of the lecture hall. After the project, there's also a participation point where you watch other groups' recorded presentations and comment something like a discussion post. There is math involved throughout the course given that it's a Physics class. It's mostly simple math except for a few concepts here and there. Lecture \"notes\" are provided/uploaded onto ELMS, which are the lecture slides that he uses in class; they're provided right before class starts.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-01-24T22:13:37.028027Z"}, {"professor": "Matt Severson", "course": "PHYS102", "review": "Professor Severson is an okay professor.

He has random clicker questions sprinkled throughout his lectures that count as participation/attendance, but usually the dates are posted on Canvas beforehand in the assignment. He's a bit slow with grading as well. Overall, you'll probably be doing a good amount of self-study outside of class to solidify your understanding of the concepts for the exam.

He was also very unapproachable from my experience, from office hours when his door is almost shut with the lights off to emails that are not professional and are very little help. He also did not follow the rule of grading final exams within 48 hours and that was probably because we still had 2 homework assignments ungraded. Overall, the workload was not much.
