She ran this class just like a book club, and helped create a really relaxed vibe where we just talk. Some days we would spend 5 minutes or so just doing creative writing. The reading load was quite heavy; we read 5 books completely, and partially read several others. Outside of reading though, there are very few assignments. Most weeks, there was a discussion board we had to post to. We also had to do a book report on any middle grade or YA book, with someone presenting at the start of each class. The final project was very open with a lot of options for the format, and it could relate to any aspect of the class. \r\nYou could really tell Lara loves teaching this class, and it was definitely an enjoyable break from the stress of every other class, so I strongly recommend it.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2021-12-18T17:55:56Z"}, {"professor": "Ingrid Satelmajer", "course": "HHUM205", "review": "Satelmajer loves to talk and expects you to complete all the readings.

She made participation a part of the class grade and worked to create a discussion environment where everyone in the class shared stories and opinions.

In terms of the work, there were sources to interact with for every class, reflection pop quizzes, short responses, a final project, and a field trip to D.C. (for extra credit).

I genuinely believe she doesn't mean to be difficult or backhanded in any way. However, she has made some concerning comments, especially in relation to mental health issues and classist/racist government practices. In addition, her teaching style is a bit frustrating. While she is very knowledgeable about what she teaches and the course content is interesting, she takes very few grades and is a harsh grader. She gives super long study guides for exams and then puts material on the test that wasn't on there (so... what's the point?). Throughout the entire semester, we took four grades. We had to revise our papers many times over until they were exactly to her liking, down to the word choice (swapping one adjective for another synonym). The assignments didn't have rubrics, only guidelines. Once she even put our papers up on the board in front of the entire class and told us all the things we had down wrong.

Many of the readings felt very repetitive and drawn out. By the end of the semester, we only had two grades and it was hard to know where we stood with our final grade. He was a somewhat harsh grader. When our final paper came, he added an optional extra credit assignment and when I did not intend to do it, he emailed me and suggested I do it. However, I had no idea what my grade was, and when I asked he gave a vague answer and still did not tell me. The whole semester I had an A, but after he decided to put in the final and extra credit I had a B+.
