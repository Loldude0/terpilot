The course itself is interesting and I learned a lot of things regarding Asian American history that I would've otherwise never known about for who knows how long? The only potential problem is that Prof Chung's way of delivering the information can be a bit boring at times - there's a lack of engagement with lectures (but this also could be due to the later time of the class making everything feel tiring).
