She also had a substitute teacher come to class on the day we had our MIDTERM so we couldnt ask questions, and did not let us know in advance that she was going to do that.\n\r\nShe most certainly plays favorites, and if youre shy to talk in class she wont like you. She also cares more about quantity over quality. I found that while writing decent things but in shorter lengths she gave me bad grades. When I lengthened what I was writing, though not adding any better content, she gave much higher grades.\n\r\nThis is NOT a teacher I would reccomend taking a class with if you are quiet in class, and bad at bullshitting to make your essays longer.

She is funny and knowledgeable. Expect to have quite a few assignments a week (film analysis, literature analysis, or a mix of both). While you could get away with putting minimal effort into them, I suggest taking them seriously, as the questions she asks explore concepts and themes that will be on the midterm and the final. They may feel like busy work (I'd argue that sometimes they are), but they can serve as a good study resource if done well. She teaches based off of slides that contains few words, so sometimes it is challenging to discern what to takes notes on- this is why I'd recommend using the homework assignments to guide your note-taking. During lectures, I just listened and jotted down recurring concepts and terminology. Some materials can be a bit dense if your Spanish skills aren't nearing those of a fluent/native speaker. If you fall into that category, don't worry, she reviews materials in class and gives out assignments that mirror potential exam questions so you know what to expect. The final analysis paper is divided into 3 steps (outline, draft, final) and takes a nontrivial amount of time, so be sure to start early and utilize office hours.

She wants to see you succeed which is really necessary for a class that moves super fast and doesn't provide too much time to delve into too much details.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I noted that some may have problems with is that usually for the first 10 minutes of every class she'll talk to us in English about something completely unrelated to the material.
