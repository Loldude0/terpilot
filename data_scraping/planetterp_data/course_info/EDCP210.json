Based on participation and engagement. Readings was a lot but you do not need to keep up with them to pass with an A.         All essays are graded fairly but please know how to do APA format correctly. All quiz or test are open note, but do know that questions will be more specific according to the slides and readings. The other comment mentioned it was extremely difficult which is not true. \r\na). They either was not coming to class b). Not paying attention c). Not reading or simply skimping over the readings d). Not taking notes\r\ne). Or all the above. \r\n\r\nI took both of his classes \"EDCP210\" and \"EDCP 230\" and received an A with a decent amount of effort. \r\n\r\nSomeone described him as \"passive aggressive\" but that it is not true. He is very direct and will challenge your ideology and perspective through questions. He is respectful and does not rush to give a response to you in the moment. \r\nPlease understand he is a graduate student studying counseling; he is more equipped in having conversations on the topic of mental health. \r\nDo not be offended if he does not agree; he will not say that in a blunt manner, but he will simply ask you to elaborate your point(s) and may sometimes reiterate what you said to confirm the point you are making. \r\nWhich is ironic because he's teaching you that through the three stage model of counseling in EDCP210 which is: \r\n1). Exploration 2). Insight 3). Action. \r\n\r\nThe class is not \"boring\" (to me) depending on your classmates engagement. \r\nSome individuals are not comfortable expressing their feelings or experiences which makes it difficult to create an environment for everyone to particpate. \r\nI am not saying give us your life story BUT if no one participates in discussions then how can it be \"fun\".\r\n\r\nIn EDCP210 it is more engaging because you will be doing helping sessions with partners and group projects. \r\n\r\nEDCP230 is more focused on you and the diaries you do bi-weekly. \r\nYou learn more about happiness and what type of happiness you lean more towards (Hedonism v. Eudemonic). \r\n\r\nMr. Daniel is a good instructor. He has granted extensions for the whole class during mid terms.\r\nThere were times where I deserved to be graded hard for missing content in essays or projects and I still received an A or B at minimum. \r\nHe provides extra credit opportunities throughout the course.\r\nHe cares about his students well-being.
