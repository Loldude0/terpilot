He's so caring, funny, and passionate about what he teaches, and the TAs in the course (Rasha and Carla) were also super sweet and amazing. There were weekly assignments on readings which were pretty easy and a bit tedious at times, but they also really helped me with understanding the readings better. The midterm was open-note and explained very thoroughly, and Dr. Slater cancelled our final exam (I'm telling you he's genuinely the best). Dr. Slater is also a very fair and easy grader. Lectures and discussions were so fun and engaging and I'm genuinely so sad this class is over. My favorite class ever, 100% take it (or any other course with Slater) if you can!!!", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-01-07T09:14:00.256372Z"}, {"professor": "Wayne Slater", "course": "TLPL206", "review": "Dr Slater is a picturesque, too-good-to-be-true professor.
