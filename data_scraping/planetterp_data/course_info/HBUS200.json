Managers need the ability to reason clearly and articulate this reasoning to others.  Managers need to be able to follow the points made by their teammates and understand the thinking from those outside the organization. To achieve these goals, this course focuses first on illuminating the key elements of critical thinking, deliberation, collaboration, and mutual understanding. It provides students the opportunity to make their own reasoning explicit, reflect on the quality of thinking around them, and to engage, challenge, and learn from the thinking of others in a constructive manner. It dives deep into understanding design thinking, and how one can apply principles of design thinking to build empathy and gain insights into others' perspectives. Finally, the course provides students the opportunity to apply their learning to innovate in an uncertain context.", "is_recent": true, "geneds": null}
