The major issues are the professor lacks good communication on assignments, didn't want to give rubrics for assignments, and did not seem open to feedback for improvement. The quizzes are pretty simple but the graded assignments are not as her instructions were confusing.

What I would say is please review slides when doing quizzes as she worlds the, very difficult and they are most of your grade. The midterm is very iffy because you have to write down a lot even with not a lot of material. As a person, she's super nice 5/5 and as a professor, I would give it a 3/5.

After a few weeks, this became one of my favorite classes. This professor studied literature, and you can tell he is passionate about it. Every class is formatted with some form of media that we discuss as a class, and he really tries to get the class thinking critically and outside the box. The class delves into deep rooted issues and topics that you wouldn't think would be the focus of the class at first glance, but it makes sense and it makes for an extremely interesting class. Attendance is semi mandatory, but he will make it so that you want to attend anyways. This professor clearly cares for his students learning, and for their well being. Many professors have not cared about my personal struggles at all, and Juan has made sure that I am doing ok and accommodated, even at times when I didn't need it or didn't ask.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-11-10T09:56:59.948946Z"}, {"professor": "Juan Diaz", "course": "LACS234", "review": "Juan is awesome!
