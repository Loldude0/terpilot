Note: The readings were NOT as interesting as I thought they would be. The vast, vast majority of readings fell greatly below my expectations. Definitely not as interesting as I thought they would be and other people here have made them seem.\n\r\nThe amount of information she can ask on the exams is ridiculous, there is so much material to cover per exam. While the exams end up not being that hard, it is frustrating that she would assign so much additional information that never makes it onto the exam. And I mean ALOT of information. Information that a decent student would probably spend studying and stressing out about for an upwards of an additional two hours per exam. It pretty much all comes down to blatant memorization of way too many names, then their roman names as well, then their attributes, then who are they related too, etc. etc. etc.\n\r\nThe study guides she gives you are not very helpful, they in essence tell you to study everything. There are parts of the study guides which single out specific events and learnings to study, and sometimes they do not even appear on the exam! Very frustrating.\n\r\nI however do feel like the minority in my judgement of this class. I feel like everyone that took this is either a Classics major or came into the class with a great deal of prior knowledge about mythology (more than your typical high school learnings go). Maybe I'm just a total dumbass. Who knows.\n\r\nThe only thing that made it bearable was my T.A. He was funny and interesting and keep us all in good spirits. If you're considering this class get Sepulva for a T.A.\n\r\nFinal Note: I felt like for the vast majority of this class, spark notes/ cliff notes are just not going to cut it. She changed the exam up for our second one where we would have to identify exact quotes from characters, who was talking, who was listening, and what it was about. They were moderately difficult even for someone that has read all the required material. \n\r\nI definitely put the most work into this class this semester and I thought it was more difficult than than ECON201 and accounting I.", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2010-12-16T16:35:00Z"}, {"professor": "Lillian Doherty", "course": "CLAS170", "review": "Professor Doherty is very very nice and knows a lot about the class.

She does what she can to help you in the class, always has a positive attitude, clearly loves the material, and while I didn't reach out to her much, she was helpful when I did. Grades are split into 4 sections: 3 midterms, and homework. The lowest 4 homework grades get dropped, but she only ended up assigning 5, so I only had to do 1. Midterms are online and open note. This format unfortunately isn't good if you want to actually learn anything; I procrastinated prep for one of the midterms until 2 days before the test, did well, and have forgotten most of it by now. Having sat in the back, I could see what a lot of people were *actually* doing on their computers, and it was very rarely taking notes. She just stands there and talks at us, which I guess is her job, but she does NOTHING to get us to actually pay attention each class. If you're a little more diligent than me, you don't even have to go to class, you can just self study everything. All material covered is posted on canvas (4/5 in terms of her knowledge of how to use canvas btw), and she posts the slides anyways... which she doesn't bring to class finished. Pretty much every class, she's had to make a correction somewhere. Slides are also extremely bland, though readable. In terms of reading, there will be a lot, and most of it is the original poetry (translated of course, but still poetry). If that's not your thing, save yourself and do what I did: don't read any of it. Instead, use whatever other resources you have. Youtube, litcharts, sparknotes, you name it. This is mythology, there are resources on this everywhere. I haven't read a single line of poetry for this class (besides excerpts we read in class) and I've been doing fine. Youtube is going to be a lot more helpful earlier in the course, but don't just watch a single video and call it a day. Every video has a slightly different version of the myth, so watch a bunch and use their common ground, then correct anything you got wrong in class.\r\n\r\nI took this during freshman connection, though I don't think that affected much. This is an okay way to get a humanities gened, especially if you like Greek & Roman mythology.", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2022-12-03T17:14:10.550763Z"}, {"professor": "Katherine Wasdin", "course": "CLAS170", "review": "dr wasdin is a great lecturer and knows her mythology. i really enjoyed her class and it made me enjoy learning more about myths. there are a lot of readings, however, if you go to lecture/discussion and pay attention, you'll be fine and probably wont have to read much outside of class. there were 3 essays, a midterm, and a final. she posts study guides for each week and she always tell us what is on the midterm or final and what she expects for each essay.

She puts all of the readings on ELMS, so you don\u2019t need to worry about buying textbooks. She assigns readings every week, but they tend not to be super long, and you don\u2019t really need to read them. As long as you understand the general gist of the mythology, you\u2019re set. Lectures could be long at times, but she does her best to tell the myths like stories, and she often lets the class out pretty early.  Throughout the course there were 3 midterms which each focused on only that unit of study.  They had 50 MC questions and 2 free responses, but you could chose which 2 to answer out of 3 questions, which really helped me out.  There were five homework\u2019s assigned, but she drops the four lowest, so theoretically you only have to do one all semester, plus they are only supposed to be 2 pages long.
