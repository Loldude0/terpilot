Dr. Mower is so passionate about what he teaches and genuinely cares about each and every one of his students. He keeps his students engaged all class and doesn't just assign useless work. Each week he gave us interesting readings (sometimes videos) and we would have to do a discussion post and article annotation. At first, they took time, but once you get in the groove they are really easy. There are 3 mini-essays, which I found actually to be enjoyable which are accompanied by 3 quizzes. The quizzes are open notes but can still be challenging because they ask very specific questions about the readings and lectures. There is also 1 media-text project which I enjoyed but it was very time-consuming. I really enjoyed his class and would definitely take another one with him. His TA Emilio is also great, and grades really fairly. If you need an easy gen-ed I would definitely recommend this class.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A-", "created": "2023-01-23T19:11:08.009334Z"}, {"professor": "Ronald Mower", "course": "KNES225", "review": "A bit of reading, but very interesting class and on the easier side of classes.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-12-07T03:29:55.173197Z"}, {"professor": "Ronald Mower", "course": "KNES225", "review": "Good professor!
