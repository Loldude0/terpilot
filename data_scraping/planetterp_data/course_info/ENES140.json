I spent around 30 minutes a week on this course due to small quizzes each week. Take the quizzes seriously however because it is 5 questions, 5 points, and there are only 100 total normal points in this course, so every question wrong is 1% down in your grade. As long as you can CTRL F the textbook/video transcripts, ChatGPT (sometimes unreliable), or do quizzes with a partner (what I did), you will be fine. The Term project at the end is pretty easy, a bit long. I was able to just grind and complete the whole thing in 2 1/2 hours. You have to buy his textbook otherwise you can't do the class ($35). \r\nAssignment breakdown:\r\n- Evaluations (10), 10%, as long as you complete them in the textbook, you get the points. They're basically surveys. Screenshot your results to save them for the Term Project later on.\r\n- Quizzes (9), 45%\r\n- Term Project: Preliminary Phases (3), 6%, a few sentences at max for 3 parts. Easy.\r\n- Term Project: Final Phase (1), 39%, just grind it and you can complete it easily, doesn't take long.\r\n- OPTIONAL Peer Review of Project (1), +1%, just 4 write up questions about someone else's project. What me and my roommate did was just write our peer review for our own projects in each other's voices to save us time.\r\n\r\nProfessor: The ONLY thing good about him is that his class is online and asynchronous. He does NOT care for you, he does NOT care about your education, he does NOT care about your grade.
