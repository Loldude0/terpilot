He is  the most rude and bitter man I have ever encountered. DURING our \u201creview\u201d he wouldn\u2019t even turn the light off when a student nicely asked him too because nobody could actually SEE HIS notes for the exam. I put \u201creview\u201d in quotations because his idea of a review is not at all helpful in preparing for the exam. He refuses to give you the answers to the worksheet he hands out. You\u2019ll spend the whole class trying to figure out the answers and he will not answer any questions. \r\nHe teaches calc on a PowerPoint which has proven to be the LEAST EFFECTIVE way to do this. Don\u2019t bother trying to write anything down because you won\u2019t have time & if you do you won\u2019t be able to pay attention to how you actually do it. Although he does a terrible job of explaining the information anyway. \r\nIf you have the great misfortune of having him as your teacher you will have to listen to him go over stupid class rules nearly every class. ONE time he even spent 20 minutes in the beginning of class going over \u201cbike safety\u201d. Nobody else in the class understood why he was doing this or what was going on. However I knew exactly what happened because the day before I saw him screaming at some kid riding his bike because he almost got hit by him. So basically he wasted all of our time because of his own personal issues. He is the worst. \r\nThe TA\u2019S even admit he makes exams 10x harder then necessary. My TA told my class that for teachers like Tim who make the exams harder than the worksheets and homework he gives you, you should research online other schools and their coursework to try and learn the information. Because it\u2019s my job to teach myself right?! \r\nIf you take this class this will 100% be the case. Guaranteed you\u2019ll be teaching yourself all of the information. If you have absolutely no background in calc then you are extremely screwed for his class. \r\nThere are also no curves in his class even though so many people argue how unfair his tests are. ALSO, his advice to go look at passed exams will not help you in the slightest. He claims that they are similar to the exams, but they\u2019re not at all. \r\nI learned more WHEN THE TA sub\u2019d for him for a day and actually wrote and explained the information on the board, then during the whole semester with him teaching. \r\nAnother thing is that you\u2019ll have lecture quizzes all the time in this class. He says they\u2019re only once a week but a lot of times they\u2019re twice a week. If you leave lecture even 10 min early there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll miss one because sometimes he\u2019ll give them in the last 5 min of class!! \r\nThere is also SO MUCH HW.. at least 5 assignments with 10-15 problems each w likelihood of having a-e parts as well due every week. \r\nIt is clear that he doesn\u2019t understand the concept of actually teaching. I highly recommend you look elsewhere for teachers because unless you are amazing at calc you will spend the the full semester trying to learn on your own.\r\n 1 star is an overstatement for this man, he deserves 0. \r\n", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "B-", "created": "2019-04-10T03:53:23Z"}, {"professor": "Ramon Braza", "course": "MATH120", "review": "A horrible teacher.

Pilachowski makes succeeding in the course a lot harder than needed be. He is the laziest professor I have ever had. His lectures consist of at least 20 minutes of rambling before getting to any actual math, and even then, he'll still interrupt his own teaching and give you some anecdotal story that has absolutely no reason to be brought up and just wastes time. When the lecture is 50 minutes long, you shouldn't be wasting at least 20 minutes talking about past students or your disdain for scooters on campus, please teach. That's another thing, his teaching or the lack thereof. Pilachowski relies heavily on slides posted in the canvas classroom to \"teach\". They are very brief, with a few examples he works through in class. Occasionally he'll spend a slightly longer amount of time doing one to stress something, but usually he'll just blast through them as fast as he can and explains nothing. He wouldn't have to rush if he just shut up at the beginning of classes...He has his lectures from Covid times posted in the Canvas classroom so there is basically no point going in person, and those you can skip through his ramblings in. Still, they're the same as his in-person lectures, so there is very little difference between the two. He doesn't do any grading, thats all up to your TA, mine was kinda the only reason I wasn't failing throughout the semester. I'll admit, my grade was not entirely due to Pilachowski's horrible teaching style, I underestimated the amount of effort  needed for exams in this course. His exams are basically the same as the practice exams provided in the test bank, just study for them more than I did. His review sessions are pointless, unless you have bad TAs who don't do something outside of class (i.e. they don't have review sessions of their own). Once again, he wastes time sitting there talking, saying the same things he says before every class for at least 10 minutes, and then tells you to do it all yourself basically. With the remaining 5 minutes of time, he'll then give you useless comments on each question, displayed in the tiniest font possible, making it impossible to read or understand what he's explaining if you don't have his review sheet directly in front of you.Teach yourself the material and get help outside of the classroom if you need it, cause Pilachowski sure won't make this class easy.
