As others said, Dickerson is a nice guy and he's a decent lecturer. I found the lecture content, however, to be boring. Perhaps this was just me excepting data science to be less math oriented and theoretical. The lectures would sometimes seem to be overly complicated. The content that you learned in lectures barely helped for the projects. I remember being quite frustrated by the first project because I was going through slides and I didn't know how to do it. Once you realize that the projects are a lot of Googling how to use the tools they give you (such as Pandas and numpy), they become pretty easy. Even though they were easy, the projects were tedious and uninteresting, and they do take quite a bit of time. I expected more of a coding class, but you have to explain and analyze a lot of things in your project (which is I guess how data science is, but I found it uninteresting). There's only four projects, however, and the fourth one (the map one) was pretty short and interesting. The projects were graded leniently, with averages in the high 90s, but they took way too long to grade them. The midterms didn't end up being too difficult, but he had basically no practice material. It'll probably get better as time goes on since he'll just re-use old exams as practice, but I had no idea how to prepare for his midterms. Since the projects have basically nothing to do with lecture, I stopped going after the second midterm (there's no final exam, just a final project). He has you do weekly reading quizzes and they were pass/fail, so they were pretty much free points. The final project is basically what you make out of it.

I personally really enjoy his class and he makes lectures fun. \r\n\r\nThe way he is teaching CMSC320 is unusual but it comes from a person who has worked in the field, which holds a lot of value in my eyes. \r\n\r\nProjects: not easy but he is reusing projects from other semesters so I don\u2019t understand why people are complaining. A lot of project work is fully self taught, which isn\u2019t unusual for CS courses. The project grading is lenient and Max is super easy to talk to if you have any issues. If you don\u2019t want to self learn then you are going to have a lot of trouble in various CS courses, it\u2019s just how it is unfortunately \r\n\r\nExam 1: This exam was online so we had access to Google and any notes we had taken. The average was around 65% but Max is giving us a generous curve and again, none of this is unusual for a CMSC course, it\u2019s only really bad if the professor isn\u2019t fair with curving based on the averages, which is not the case here. There were technical difficulties but Max accommodated for that and helped anyone that had issues. Also, the vast majority of the grade comes from projects so this isn\u2019t even a big deal\r\n\r\nLectures: Max talks about the fundamental topics briefly and doesn\u2019t go into too much detail. Again, most of the code you will learn is self taught and contained in the projects, lecture is for high level explanations of the different topics of the course. Max also shares stories about projects he had to do in industry and problem solving techniques he used to get his solutions. All very practical and useful information. if you\u2019re a geek that doesn\u2019t care about real life and want to stuff your face in a text book and fully learn everything in depth, this gem of a lecturer isn\u2019t for you. \r\n\r\nOverall thoughts: I personally think this class is a breath of fresh air amongst the sea of boring and difficult computer science courses. Max actually makes me want to come to lecture as opposed to feeling like I have to. I love having professors that are easy to talk to and feel more down to earth. This is definitely one of the rare instances of a professor that understands that students have a life outside of their course and is willing to accommodate for real excuses. \r\n\r\nOther ratings: I honestly feel like Max is getting a lot of unfair reviews. This is his first semester teaching the course and he is demonstrating a clear willingness to learn and improve as a professor. There are lots of complaints about the unorganized lecture styles, which is a fair criticism that I\u2019m sure he will address in the future, but also bs criticism about an exam that isn\u2019t worth very much of our grade and projects that he didn\u2019t even write? These are literally reused projects from other semesters so if that\u2019s the complaint then you have a problem with the class, not Max. There seems to be two sides to this. If you want to hear real life experiences and get advice about how to make it in the industry, then you\u2019ll like Max. If you\u2019re looking for a professor that solely focuses on teaching the class material, then Max is not for you.\r\n\r\nConclusion: He a little confused but he got the spirit", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "B", "created": "2022-11-12T11:32:52.662848Z"}, {"professor": "Maksym Morawski", "course": "CMSC320", "review": "Great professor that is a little unorganized but makes up for it with real life industry work experience.

There was a sample midterm given, but the actual exam was nothing like it. You were allowed to bring a cheat sheet, but that didn't matter. It was essentially random python trivia about random inbuilt python, pandas, numpy, or data-cleaning techniques/commands. If you didn't have it on your cheat sheet, you would not be able to answer the question. These commands had nothing to do with class or the projects. It also included topics that were briefly mentioned in class, not really in the class slides, and that question would be work 20% of the midterm. Almost fully random, the best way to classify this midterm is like a history test, but your textbook is the whole internet. Good luck.\r\n\r\nThe final was better. I believe he understood what he did from the first midterm, so he made the final closer to the practice final and kept it related to the class content.

Grading takes forever (Homework due late October still is not back yet) and Prof. Morawski doesn't seem to really care about that. Our final project was released extremely late and last homework was also released really late. Barely any communication about this. The last homework was released so late that we were basically expected to work on it over Thanksgiving break, when it was originally supposed to be due 2 weeks before break. None of the homework is that hard (IMO at least) but it's just annoying that you continuously have to check up to see if the professor has even released the homeworks when he's already behind schedule. \r\n\r\nProf. Morawski also is just bad at teaching, plain and simple. Lectures seemed more like a stand up routine to him. As other reviewers said, the slides have minimal info, and equations are often wrong. There's no clear definitions for anything, you'll have to look elsewhere. Everything is taught in an example/high level way but you are expected to understand and replicate at a low detailed level. For example, with hypothesis tests, you will not find detailed definitions in the slides that include everything he wants you to know. You have to google these things or use the other prof's slides. This is kind of insane to me as Prof. Morawski has taught this class MULTIPLE times before. And, you can tell that he thinks his teaching style is superior to other professors, which is frankly hilarious as he also goes on about how he thinks he didn't explain things well or how the exams he wrote/gave us are bad exams.\r\n\r\nHomeworks and projects always needed numerous corrections-- again, kind of ridiculous for a professor who has taught this class before. Good luck starting the homework early, because he will probably change multiple things in the first few days of homework release. \r\n\r\nExams had questions where you were supposed to use your \"real world brain\" and think outside the box. What does this actually mean? Trick questions and ones that are long/confusingly worded for no reason. We had some tricky questions on things that he *explicitly* did not teach us previously due to cancelling class multiple times or having the other prof teach us for a class. I understand that he had to cancel class for personal issues, but I didn't think it was fair to have tough questions on concepts that he himself did not teach us.\r\n\r\nAnyway, all of the below reviews are very accurate as to how you will feel about Prof. Morawksi.

There are still truths to some complaints here, but the positives are still far greater than the negatives and the way it's taught is so unique so I think people should still take this class with Max (or at least go to his 320 lectures when they happen, since they're quite interesting, humorous, and thought provoking).\r\nFirst, the cons: Yes, the class was quite disorganized, we had an assignment due in October that wasn't graded until the last day of finals. Some problems were unclear or needed us to search up information on our own (but this research was very simple and not really an issue). He is unprepared sometimes; he mentioned some lectures went way faster than expected, or will forget to put something very important on slides, and also stopped posting recordings for lectures which made it a bit hard to study for exams. Additionally, he isn't the best at math, so he'll sometimes make mistakes on some slides or formulas, but in practice we hardly used formulas so this hardly disrupted the flow of the class. In terms of grades, the other section for Fall 2023 (with Fardina) was basically a guaranteed A (the average on Max's exams was about 77%, Fardina's average on exams was about 92%) so honestly, if grade is the [only] thing you care about, maybe you should take it with Fardina based on the stats.\r\nBut Max's section and thoughts have many positives: The overall grade for the regular assignments and final project (which were worth 55% of the class) was at 95% so no one really risked failing the class, and most of these took just around 2-4 hours to complete since there are lots of guides to do what was asked. Where Max really shines is in his lectures: they were the most consistently engaging ones that I've been through at the university, always getting people to ask questions, cracking jokes and being relatable on what being in CS is like. The way he teaches the course isn't just learning data science in how to design & execute an experiment, because he also notes where it's relevant and useful (he mentions how Goodhart's law is seen in practice through grade inflation, I wonder where this could be present...), what the industry currently uses in practice (how does Netflix or Amazon actually recommend things), and bringing his own industry experience to elaborate on what we would do working in data science. Additionally, he also goes on some important side tangents about other important topics, like critically thinking about what grades are, career advice and thinking about interviews, how to ingest ethics in practice, and other considerations in life that many other professors don't touch (he informally holds a group of people that learn more on these general life skills).

Many students complain that his slides are not comprehensive and that we need to google most concepts to better prepare for exams. However, I would argue that this reflects exactly what data scientists (and most CS related jobs) are doing in the industry.

Max's style of teaching prepares the students to better navigate real-world challenges and to not be always \"spoon-fed\" with information.\r\n\r\nRegarding the coursework, Max's exams are essentially about two things: Demonstrating basic understanding and extending the class ideas to real-world situations. I didn't study a lot for exam 1 and the final, and I got an A in both of them. If you hope that you will get an A by memorizing concepts and not actually understanding how the algorithms work and the math behind them (in a general/basic level), do not take the class with Max.  However, I must mention that Max sometimes messes up exams, where the average would be 70% or less. Though, you can always get partial credit and extra credit in all of his exams and assignments.
