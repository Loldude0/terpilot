She was incredibly unprofessional in regards to how she handled the class. For example, this course is all about revising and improving your work, how is that in any way possible when it takes OVER 1 month to receive grades in feedback. This is unacceptable, students have deadlines that we have to abide, how can teachers have this much time to return grades. It is completely unacceptable. I was in no way able to learn from my work because each new major assignment needed to be turned in BEFORE I received the grade and feedback from the previous assignment. Even the academic summary which was a mere 300 words took over 3 weeks to grade! I find this extremely contradictory to what the class is supposed to do. I spent long and late nights working on the papers she assigned and met almost every deadline, but she does not have the respect for her students to turn back grades and feedback in a more timely manner. All it ended up being was busy work after busy work. Along with this, the teacher had the audacity to accuse the class not once, but twice of racially profiling her. She cited reasons as lack of trying or attention in class. To accuse a class of around 20 students of racially profiling her is a testament to this teachers character. She believed that our lack of effort towards the class was rooted in our perception of her race and ethnicity, rather than the more obvious fact of her POOR teaching skills. The fact that we as a class got accused o racially profiling her is deeply concerning and uncomforting and frankly unacceptable. When asked, \"When will we receive our final grades\" in the third to last class, she responded with her normal bothered attitude, \"You will get it when you get it\". She runs the class with this very uninviting tone and then claims about how friendly and open she is, which is an absolute fallacy. I have learned absolutely nothing in this course, we used fearless writing, a textbook worth over $100 a bunch of times but gained absolutely nothing from it! It was a waste of money and it's again unacceptable that a mandatory class has a mandatory bok that is not covered within tuition! There are so many things wrong with both the structure of this course and the professor who \"taught\" it. Taught is in quotes because she did not teach me a single thing. If you create a course based o rewriting and revising your work, either give professors enough time to grade papers so that there is time for learning from our previous work, or hire teachers who can grade in a timely manner.

Carson goes over some techniques of \u201ceffective writing\u201d for assignments, but when it boils down to what she expects of you to do, the lines can be blurred and it is really up to your interpretation. I think the most frustrating part of Carson\u2019s class was how late she puts in the grades. Even after the first semester is officially done, she still only has half of our grades in so it is hard to gauge how well we are doing in the class. Very frustrating. One of Carson\u2019s strong suits, however, is her effective communication with the class. There were times where she allowed extensions and due dated became flexible (sometimes for the whole class, most times for individuals) but I would not rely on that too much. \r\n\r\nOverall, Carson is an ok professor.

Just make sure to turn in your assignments and don\u2019t push them off until the last minute.\r\nBreakdown:\r\n- Assignments (31), 50%, consists of discussions, quizzes, and other miscellaneous assignments. Put in the effort and you should have a high grade on these assignments.\r\n- Research Project (11), 50%, all of your essays, final websites, and work towards your research project is here. These take a while and the essays are pretty long. Your final paper should have 20 citations, 10 of which are scholarly. Final paper should be 8-10 pages. You work towards it, but it is a lot to do. Make sure you work on it consistently and start early, otherwise you will be up until 3 AM doing your paper.\r\n\r\nProfessor: Super super sweet! Has a fun British accent and is really good at keeping lectures engaging. She often will make jokes in class that everyone likes.

While ENGL101 is not a very interesting or engaging class, Professor Pettus made it much more bearable. We did ice-breakers before most classes and then began to work. There are a few assignments here and there, but they are mostly just essay drafts and finals. There was one longer paper (10 pages), but the others were very bearable (3-5 pages).

There were times where she was very passive aggressive during email correspondence with people in my class and she had to follow up with apology emails. The class assignments are displayed on a google doc, but she and our TA would modify it last minute without notifying the class. This led to people not getting work done in time or doing exorbitant amounts of work done well before deadlines. There was one instance where more than half of our class wrote an 8-page research paper draft in 3 days and then during class she acted dumb and said the deadline was actually a week from then.

There are nightly readings to complete and we often would spend 20-40 minutes having an in-class discussion about what we had read. She tries to make the class a very inclusive environment and have people be comfortable speaking. She cared about each of her students and knew small details like what our paper topics were and was sure to help during class. Some of our in-class activities could seem pointless and time-consuming, however, they were extremely easy so I often did not mind. She is a very lenient grader and only asks that you meet the essay requirements in order to get a good grade. Writing skills/content was not that important. The only reason I did not give her 5 stars was because she was a very very slow grader and did not provide feedback fast enough to apply it in the next essay.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2024-01-03T21:35:16.916493Z"}, {"professor": "Robert Harris", "course": "ENGL101", "review": "The fact the class is ridiculously easy props up his honestly poor teaching.\r\n\r\nI don't think I learned a single thing from his teaching in class. If he assigned all of the writing assignments at the very start of the semester I think I would have largely produced the same essays.\r\nHis teaching style is hard to explain. He really doesn't teach concepts clearly at all and will ask very open-ended vague questions to the class and then be shocked when no one raises their hand. While I participated more than most of the class I often felt like I was taking a shot in the dark when answering questions and could be completely off base with my answer. \r\nFor an English professor, this is honestly quite a shocking problem to have as I would expect him to be the most clear and concise teacher however that is not the case at all. \r\nOverall turning the work in on time and not procrastinating to an insane degree on the writing assignments will get you a pretty decent grade in the class. \r\nOh and one more thing. The review about him putting his mood on the class like we are in high school is absolutely correct. If a lot of people are absent or we didn't read the textbook pages he would be in a mood and either assign bs busy work or just cancel class/end early.\r\nOh and another thing. He is extremely disorganized on canvas so knowing what reading we were supposed to have done was literally impossible.

As for her lectures, her style of lecturing is really un-engaging, often reading straight from the slides.
