It would have been really helpful if he did that, because basically if you failed to understand it during lecture time you never got another chance to hear an explanation. I also wish he used a screenrecorder to record slides as he lectures. The recordings just had terrible quality. Another problem I had was that piazza responses were pretty slow, even though the class size wasn't all that big. Usually took 1-2 days for a reply. Another problem I had with this class is that one part of the class involved some vector calc stuff (Calc 3) even though its not a prereq for this course.

If you want information about the course syllabus, you can just search up \"cmsc426 prg\" and you should see the Perception and Robotics Group which has links to all of the syllabi from when this course was taught.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- The lectures were helpful for doing well on the midterm, and marginally helpful for the projects. I went to most of the lectures, and I would say they were better for getting a conceptual idea about certain topics. He also writes stuff on the board (equations, diagrams, derivations) that are not in the slides so I would suggest going because just reading the slides alone is pretty confusing. They did help me in some of the projects, and going to them likely boosted my score on the midterm. The professor also did some review before the midterm which was pretty helpful. The lectures also became very close-knit after a few weeks since most people didn't bother coming to them, so if you had questions it was pretty easy to ask.\r\n- The projects were at least about interesting topics in computer vision. The last project even involved using a machine learning model for a practical application, so I think they were probably the most interesting and helpful part of the course. Also, we had 8 late days total to use for the first 3 projects, so that we could get full credit even if we used a few late days.\r\n- Grading was lenient in my opinion (The professor says he \"doesn't believe in grades\"). The median grades for all projects besides the last one were all 100%, producing some output and writing a good report was good enough to get a good score. The midterm exam was a little difficult (median 80%). Also, we had a \"participation\" grade where all you had to do was say something in the Piazza at least 15 or so times, which literally everyone got full credit for. The final project had a median of 75%, that was definitely one that they graded more harshly, since your grade depended on the performance of your model. I heard the final exam was tough, but I can't speak to it since I decided to do the project instead. The overall average course grade was an A- according to the TAs. This semester, 90% was an A, 76% was a B, and 66% was a C+.\r\n- The professor is pretty nice and friendly. He is also very involved in computer vision and robotics research at UMD if that's something you are interested in.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- I said the lectures were helpful, but they definitely could have been much better. The professor had a habit of skipping over some details and that could sometimes make things hard to understand. You also better remember your linear algebra or else you won't be able to follow this class. The lectures also barely covered anything about the projects, he NEVER went over any actual code, so you had to figure out how to implement the things he's saying in Python on your own.\r\n- The TAs completely ran as far as projects, exams, and grading go. We had a piazza that the professor probably was not even a part of, the TAs were responsible for responding to questions there. Sometimes they only provided clarification for projects ON THE DAY THEY WERE DUE, which was very stressful. Sometimes they would even provide conflicting information. I would highly suggest starting these projects early especially if you don't know what you are doing. Otherwise, you will struggle.\r\n- We did not have great preparation for the midterm besides the lectures and all of their slides. At the very least, the slides, our notes, and the projects were decent material to study. The TAs provided a practice midterm, which would have been helpful had they also given us the answer key. They couldn't properly answer the questions in office hours either, rendering that practice midterm basically useless. There was no practice final, however the professor covered some questions in class that he indicated would be on the final.\r\n- Grading took an extremely long time and was not organized at all. We were split onto groups in ELMS, and somehow the TAs were always confused on who was in it what group. Project 1 was due in late September but I'm pretty sure we only got our grades in early December for that one. I'm pretty sure some people didn't even get project 3 grades by the time they submitted grades to Testudo. The midterm exam was multiple choice, because according to the TAs it would be \"faster to grade.\" It still took several weeks to grade and when we got that back, there were numerous grading errors and confusions. I'm almost positive the TAs didn't have an answer key when grading that test. After all of the regrading, my score went up by 17%.\r\n- This course barely scratches the surface of computer vision. He introduces some research in computer vision, but we are barely given any understanding of it as it is very brief in the lecture. \r\n\r\nOverall, this Professor was decent for this subject but the way he ran this class had several flaws.

One of the worst I've ever experienced. Heavy accent makes him virtually uninterpretable, and he spends the first 10m to hour talking about his anecdotes or life experiences which, to be frank, I'm not interested in.  I remember the one of many instances that I would actually try to understand his stories, he would talk about how WWII and would somehow segue that into Computer Vision. I did not learn anything in the lectures, and I'm sure majority of the class didn't either given the <20% class turnout to his lectures. \r\nMoreover, his lectures had very little to no correlation to what we were tested on in projects. I've never had been left more in the dark with a CS project in my entire life. Thankfully and fortunately, you are assigned group members and they seemed to carry me. If you are to take this class, and groups are allowed, choose your group members carefully as there are complex concepts applied to the projects. Also note that he presumed that we knew Python and the projects were in Python (I'd say most CS students are familiar with this language but just to disclaim). \r\nAlthough I am expecting an A-, I did not understand most concepts and relied heavily on my group members (which again I am thankful for); the lectures and scope of this class are horrid and the only reason of such a decent grade distribution was because of projects that could be worked with a group and piazza participation. Yes, as of F2023, there was a 10% final grade piazza participation. The only part of this class I enjoyed was the overtly enthusiastic yet sarcastic follow up \"discussions\" that people would post just to get this 10% credit. \r\nThis is the first time I've ever wrote a review about a professor so hopefully you could understand the emphatic and negative feedback I have given.", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "A-", "created": "2024-01-15T23:04:01.483659Z"}, {"professor": "Jia-bin Huang", "course": "CMSC426", "review": "Lectures are huge information dumps that can get overwhelming. We don't learn the \"why\" behind most topics and there is a huge disconnect between lecture information and implementing the code on homeworks. There is zero guidance on how to start the homework and rules and guidelines will randomly pop up on piazza but only after someone asks a question about it.

Basically the lectures are very high level concepts and he doesn't explain how to actually do any of the things he talks about beyond putting a huge, abstract algorithm/summation up on the board (without explaining) for 5 seconds. It's kind of the common L of professors who are really smart but don't know how to teach and only care about their research. The problem is that his lectures are so much of an information overload that its not really worth trying to figure out what he's talking about, because even if you do, the high level concepts aren't all that useful for projects.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of projects, some of the worst designed I've seen in my time here. Little to no directions ever, and despite the TAs being smart and helpful, they usually can't debug with you because everybody does things in exceptionally different ways and it is impossible to unit test when everything is tracking hundreds of points across tons of iterations across tons of images. Most things in this class rely on packages, but often times some things just don't work in the way you need them to and its not really possible (feasible) to figure out why in a 2 week project (ie don't use numpy.gradient for gradients, it gives garbage) . After the first project dropped lecture attendance went down like 80% because everybody realized how useless they were with respect to what the projects ask of us. \r\n\r\nHe then made class required (which is fine I don't mind) and added a midterm mid-semester (fine) but he never announces these things beyond piazza posts and doesn't update the syllabus. He makes large scale course changes and then weeks later talks about these things like they've been known (this isn't a huge issue, cause yeah, we can check piazza and whatnot, but still just a poorly managed course if he has to update the grade breakdown many times mid-semester).", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "", "created": "2024-03-14T20:23:37.213829Z"}, {"professor": "Jia-bin Huang", "course": "CMSC426", "review": "just dont even take this course. professor is cracked at comp vision but the lectures/slides just does not help with projects. students often just end up lost and have to ask piazza how to even begin.\r\ngoogle has been my best friend so far...", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "", "created": "2024-03-28T07:47:13.259300Z"}], "department": "CMSC", "course_number": "426", "name": "CMSC426", "title": "Computer Vision", "credits": 3, "description": "<b>Prerequisite:</b> Minimum grade of C- in CMSC330 and CMSC351; or must be in the (Computer Science (Doctoral), Computer Science (Master's)) program.\n<b>Restriction:</b> Permission of CMNS-Computer Science department.\nAn introduction to basic concepts and techniques in computervision.
