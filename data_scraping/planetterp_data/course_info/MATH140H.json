Additionally, Prof. Safsten explained the fundamental contents of Calculus I thoroughly. He teaches the class following the assigned chapters in the textbook. You can find the schedule of chapters in the syllabus he provides.  \r\n\r\nSince this was an H-course, there were some topics that the course skipped over, however, these topics were not covered in the Final, so no need to fret. All four midterms consisted of topics covered in class using the required textbook. He was a gracious grader; you can expect little points to be taken off if there were any algebraic errors leading to your final answer. In addition, you can challenge any grade you believe is unfair or miscalculated. The quizzes that Prof. Safsten would hand out were completely fair. They usually consist of two questions that require no more than 10 minutes. The quizzes usually cover the topics covered for that week. He automatically drops the lowest grade on one of these quizzes for your calculated grade. \r\n\r\nOne thing that I was not a fan of throughout the course was the graded discussion sheets. Prof. Safsten does not grade these discussion sheets as he hands them off to a TA to be graded. I was not aware of who the TA was, but there were instances where the TA would remove up to 1 or 2 points out of a 10-point worksheet.
