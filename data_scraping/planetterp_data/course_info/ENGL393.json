My peers in aerospace engineering are taking 393 now (Spring 2020) with other professors, so I have a decent data set to compare with.\r\n\r\nWith most instructors, English 393 is a horrible class. The papers are long, tedious, pointless, joyless trash that will leave you more confused and agitated than anything, and the biggest assignments always seem to line up with the parts of the semester when you should be studying for exams for your major courses.

She's a neuroscientist and professional career coach which makes her highly qualified to discuss the course content, and I believe she's genuinely invested in her students' success.

Another thing is that there were no late deadlines on canvas, so you couldn't submit any assignment late without having to ask him. Even then he would only allow you to do this once and still penalize you. For assignments like first drafts, if you missed the deadline you would get a zero on the peer review as well.
