Unfortunately, JWST141 is not an introductory level class and nor is it worth the effort. I attended close to every lecture, took thoughtful notes, and submitted assignments on time. In a separate course in the same semester, I earned A's and B's on papers. In Marsha's class, I was lucky to get a C, and with four assignment's throughout the semester, that does not leave much room for improvement. I took the class as an elective, hoping to expand my Jewish learning and to embrace Jewish history in America. Instead, I received my lowest grade in my undergraduate career. And this is coming from someone who has taken intro Biology and Chemistry.", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "", "created": "2021-03-04T16:16:18Z"}, {"professor": "Marsha Rozenblit", "course": "JWST141", "review": "Professor Rozenblit is a traditional lecturer. This may be a bit of an adjustment to first-year students, but if one takes good notes and asks thoughtful questions in class, they will succeed. She is very knowledgeable about her field and presents the information in an organized way, usually giving an overview of every lecture's content before delving in. She assigns readings that more reinforce what she teaches, as the meat of the content is in her lectures. To succeed on exams, a lot of prep and memorization of details is necessary, but it's an easy A if the time is spent.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2021-09-12T14:31:12Z"}, {"professor": "Marsha Rozenblit", "course": "JWST141", "review": "JWST 141 is just not it if your looking for an easy elective course.
