I had to take it as a kinesiology major. Initially I wanted to drop the class, but after the first couple of lectures, the material actually got interesting. He posts his notes online with blanks that you are able to fill in by attending lecture. He has about 5 pop quizzes a semester, all of which are very easy if you go to lecture on a regular basis. His tests are difficult, but really challenge you.

He was pretty annoying to listen to as a lecturer and he just tried to use big words to seem smart. Podcasts are posted online each week that cover all the information in class with a better lecturer, so there is no real reason to go to lecture, other than there is sometimes pop quizzes. Pretty hard to get an A in the class as the TA's grade pretty tough.

He is the most genuine and hilarious professor. He genuinely cares about what he teaches and also cares about the students. He makes his lectures fun and the class itself is really interesting. His TAs are also both really great, I had Lilah but I've heard great things about both her and Brandon. Each week there are topic source notes, which get tedious but I promise they really help in the long run. Basically, you get a question and sources and you have to pick two (1 academic, 1 non-academic) and analyze how they apply to the question plus add in your own personal experience. I loved how I was able to always add in my own experience and it is so highly encouraged. There are also only 2 essays the midterm and the final. For those, you get to pick a question from your topic source notes and then elaborate on it, so basically each week you are getting your feet wet in potential essay topics which I found super helpful. There are also weekly quizzes that are open notes and easy if you go to the lecture. Literally the first day Dr. Andrews will say he doesn't care if you go to a lecture or not, but GO I swear it's genuinely so much fun and interesting. He always adds one or two questions directly from the lecture as a way to reward those who go which makes it easy to score well. They graded the essays very thoroughly which I appreciated because they were the first real college papers I had.
