The other reviews are pretty accurate- she really cares about her students and will go above and beyond to help (as long as you ask, of course).

Also, her exams are open note and she will do her best to help you if you need clarification on a question.

At first, I was weary about taking this class, but it's not that bad or difficult. There is homework (basically lab reports) due after each class, three exams, and a final presentation, and your lab notebook gets graded. Professor Upadhyaya is a good professor, and she does want each of her students to succeed. That being said she is a bit unorganized, and demeaning at times. We didn't have a TA for half of the year, so the grading was VERY slow, and she would question you if you were confused.

This class is not super difficult because you know more than you think, and Professor Lising pulls out your own knowledge. In class there is a lot of partner activities with your lab partner. The experiments are not all boring, matter of fact one of the things we did in class was make ice cream with heavy cream, sugar, and liquid nitrogen. We also attempted to light a lightbulb with pickles. Professor Lising is so helpful if you need help. She will stay after class or come early to go over with you what you are confused about. She is also very good with on the spot questions. The best thing Professor Lising did was allow us to resubmit our final for a higher grade and that made all the difference for me.
