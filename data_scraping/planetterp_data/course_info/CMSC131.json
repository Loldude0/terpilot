He keeps the class interesting while also teaching the material in an extremely clear fashion. However, if you are new to programming languages like Java, there are obstacles that you have to overcome (Don't worry, they're not to bad!). \n\r\n1. Fawzi can't review every topic with a fine tooth comb because it's only a semester-long course, therefore the rate at which new material is introduced is fast. You will have to attend pretty much every lecture if you want to be at a good pace, and you must take copious notes - Fawzi doesn't use the textbook (don't buy the textbook, it's completely useless). \n\r\n2. The projects. The first two projects are very easy and doable...however the difficulty then increases quickly. PROJECTS ARE THE MOST CRUCIAL IN GETTING A GOOD GRADE!!! The biggest problem students have with the projects is not figuring out what to do...it's actually completing the project on time. Fawzi gives you about a week and a half to do the projects, but most people wait till the last minute and their grade suffers mightily. PLEASE START YOUR PROJECTS EARLY. I CAN'T STRESS THAT ENOUGH. \n\r\nNow that I'm done addressing those who might be new to programming entirely, let me broaden my view to everyone taking the class. Fawzi's tests are perfectly fair. Not too easy, but definitely not hard as well. Study well, and you'll do fine. PAY ATTENTION TO THOSE STUDY QUESTIONS. They're the keys to a good test score. Quizes and Labs count for a small portion of your overall grade, but make sure you don't BS them. Fawzi's Final Exam was definitely tougher than both his midterms, so don't blow that off and make sure you study hard for that one. \n\r\nFawzi is a fantastic professor and I can't imagine any professor better in the CS Department who is better.

Make sure to study a lot and go to all the discussions and lectures and to try to learn on your own time because class time is not enough.

There was a whole thing this year where the professors are going to prosecute those who cheated on projects which will result in an XF (failure and cheating mark) that will stay with you forever even if you retake the class.

A toilet bowl of intellectual thoughts flurries around your noggin; there could be computers, video games, cameras, programming, computers, flying cellphones, virtual pinball and more!\r\nThen all of a sudden.\r\nBAM!\r\nGolub's hairstyle is crazy \u2013 he\u2019s like the Yoda of comp sci. Don't underestimate his powers.\r\nAs soon as you walk through the door, the surrounding air temperature drops 30 degrees as you witness the epitome of the human race. A majestic white haired dude strides across the lecture hall and spreads his arms openly\u2013 with a devilish grin on his face \u2013 so fast you could have blinked and missed the moment of a lifetime. (I strongly advise bringing a camera to savor the moment)\r\nGolub E., or professionally known as \u201cEvan de Golub\u201d, is a retired super villain who now only uses his powers for forces of good\u2026.. for students of the CMSC major at the University of Maryland. He wears a silk vest every day - except on every other Friday. However, I personally felt like when he wasn't wearing the vest his lectures were more interesting and remained on topic. (Escalating theories in the scientific community that this very vest may have been part of his original super villain costume - and retains faint traces of pure evil.)\r\nHis vest is swaggy doe. Props to him.\r\nAlthough his receding hairline may fool you upon first glance, he has a magnificent pony tail and has the full-fledged back-head experience. But keep in mind he is no Lebron James. Golub is an extremely young person \u2013 his hair is only grey from an abundance of knowledge and sagacious wisdom he has accumulated throughout his career. (One, of course, which would take the average man many lifetimes to equal.) Golub is a young warrior, holding years of experience computer sciencing, playing wacky poker in the devious back rooms of mobster hideouts, taking photographs of people\u2019s feet and farm animals, and executing simulations of the mass genocide of pond fishies. But don\u2019t let me spoil the extravagant, Oscar-worthy backstory though. Let the Golub himself reveal it to you through his eloquent novel-worthy lectures which leave you hanging on an epic, thrilling cliff hanger after each 51 minute session. But don\u2019t worry my fellow Golub-goers, he always comes back the next week to continue the story almost where he left off, even after he has given tests that were not on the future topics he touched in the lectures \u2013 but on the stuff you should\u2019ve KNOWN ALL ALONG FROM THE START. Damn, this guy practically wrote Inception. (Before Christopher Nolan bought the rights to it.) \r\nAnyway, at first his lectures might seem pointless, spontaneous, random, unconnected, irrelevant, boring, and really confusing - but don\u2019t let that fool you.  In each session there is a small ten second topic that will become a pivotal test question somewhere down the road. Trust me. All of the spontaneous, random, unconnected, irrelevant, boring, and really confusing tangents he goes on are actually tests, testing the mental capacity of all 140 stude\u2013 I mean 45 students who bother to show up- in search for a new padawan. So if you want the prestigious position of \u201cGolub padawan\u201d on your resume, it\u2019s best you sign up right now and claim your first row seat.\r\nI strongly advise not bringing a computer to his lecture \u2013 this only distracts you from the true Golub-glorified experience. His signature hand gestures during his elegant lectures engage full houses of students \u2013 from all over the world- elevating them to the balls of their feet as he tells witty jokes that no one listens to. Seriously, one time someone almost let out a giggle and the whole universe practically collapsed inward upon itself and imploded. \r\nI suggest bringing the classic pen and notepad \u2013 which were the slim-lined computers Golub himself used when growing up in college \u2013 not those vintage clay tablets developed by the Mayans.

No matter which type of device you plan to bring, always stare at it and never make eye contact with the master while he speaks \u2013 this is a sign of challenge, an instinct Golub has picked up from his years chillin with lions and tigers and preforming weird combos to their portraits.\r\nGolub is a man with an infinite bag of tricks \u2013 did you know he was bilingual?

You\u2019ll soon learn the concept of accounting for different cultural values and measurement systems because Golub exposes the flaws of NASA and unit conversions. During his reign as supervillain, Golub encountered the forces of NASA and recollects how the US measurement of distance was different that Europe\u2019s system, causing the NASA probe to crash (wasting the hundreds of millions of dollars Golub could have used for world domination). He references this story at least once every week, which now in hindsight, I think was a reoccurring subliminal message for comp sci students: don\u2019t trust NASA.\r\nNot only will you embark on pointless, unnecessary projects while other classes are sticking closer to reality, Golub will personally teach you the secrets to his mischievous trade of the wacky poker underground. His wacky poker project seemed too wacky for my taste, but then again, I was never playing a high stakes poker game with 300 zoo animals on the line. Golub is truly a modern superhero. When I took this class I never expected to learn essential life skills including: what Rwanda\u2019s flag looks like in 3 bit-resolution, how to do calculus in Martianese notation, how to program, or even the science behind a fish pond exploiting the true concepts of Darwinism. \r\nBut now I know, and I shall hold on to these precious gifts dearly as I move on with my life.\r\nIf you have been missing a real Bill Nye the science guy in your life, then this is the opportunity of a life time.

Nelson uses his own website for posting projects details, slides, sample programs, etc...\r\n- (Not a con for me) Uses Piazza for class announcements + addressing student questions/concerns/memes (yes there is a meme folder for the class, pretty dope).", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "A-", "created": "2021-12-21T23:16:54Z"}, {"professor": "Nelson Padua-Perez", "course": "CMSC131", "review": "Nelson is great!!! If you're the type of person to get kind of bored during boring old slide lectures then he's good for you! He relies on examples in the lecture and a few small concepts from the slides. He gives us one-minute breaks in between heavy topics/examples so that we can discuss it with our neighbors, which I find really helpful in keeping everyone interactive and actually paying attention esp in a morning class. His exams are doable as long as you do the past exams/practice he gives which is really helpful. His third exam; however, was overly long and challenging compared to his others so it tanked a lot of people's grades, but he just released grades and seemed to have provided a better cutoff to benefit (f.e. some A grades were considered A+ and so on), so as long as you put the work in you should be golden in terms of your grade (it's not meant to be challenging to get an A or B). Also, his projects are definitely on the challenging side sometimes especially later in the year with Recursion and the class implementations, but if you study his class lecture code and ask for help during office hours (always go early otherwise you probably won't get a chance if it's close to the project deadline). Overall, he explains things effectively for the most part and I'd recommend reading some notes on the topics before coming into class on the first day just so you have a good idea of what coding in Java is about and you aren't bombarded too fast!

He is really laid back, chill, and constantly makes jokes and finds interesting ways to keep students engaged. This was my first time coding in Java and Nelson made it very straight forward and doable.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- Nelson is a very funny and likable guy. On the first day of classes he will tell you that he always wants you to call him by his first name which I found interesting.\r\n- He is very good at making analogies between programming and more understandable topics. For example, he would make an analogy between a bakery and objects in java. This makes it really easy to understand his teaching, even for first time programmers like me.\r\n- His lecture slides are much more detailed than Fawsi's (from what I have heard)\r\n- His exams are very much like the previous exams. As long as you study those, and the additional resources that Nelson provides, you will be more than fine on the exams.\r\n- Occasionally during every lecture, Nelson likes to say \"1 minute\" which indicates that we can talk to our neighbor for a minute and digest the information that he just lectured about. I found this useful and made the class less fast paced\u2014 gave me time to breathe while learning new information. After this minute break, he opens the floor for a few questions before returning to his lecture.\r\n- Nelson uploads the code for every class example and provides many many resources to ensure you do well on the projects and exams.\r\n- Grading for exams is honestly pretty lenient. Because all the midterms include hand-written coding, it is easy to miss the small nuances that come with programming but the TAs that grade your tests know this. Often times when you look at the grading break down, you are given points on a segment of code just for \"ATTEMPTING to _______\"\r\n- Very accommodating in regards to extending deadlines for things. He even encourages that the class speaks up if we need an extension.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- His funny personality sometimes gets in the way of the actual teaching. Yes it does lighten up the mood but often he will stop mid sentence just to pop in a joke. Additionally, some of his comedy is offensive or will get stale. For example, he once made a statement to the guys in the class about how they should not feel bad if a girl rejects them. He then goes on with his joke and says that girls are like \"instance variables\" and how the guys should just \"pick another one\" if one doesn't work. If you know anything about Java, you will know that he basically just called women \"objects\". I didn't think too much about this but I can see why some people would find his humor offensive. He also always makes the joke \"turn to your neighbor and tell them they are a (insert random java terminology)\" which literally makes no sense and gets old after the first couple times.\r\n- The third midterm was a nightmare. In the past, there have only been two midterms and the third was only added a couple years ago. This means that there is little study material and the worst part is that the second and third midterm are only 2 weeks apart since they kind of just shoved it into the curriculum. The class average for midterms is usually pretty high but dropped to a D average for this midterm. Nelson did adjust the letter grade cut offs for final grades because of this though.\r\n- Projects become very challenging towards the end of the semester. This is obviously necessary to challenge students but sometimes they are impossible to figure out without a TA.\r\n- Frankly, sometimes it is difficult to understand his accent and it leaves you to think more about what words he is saying in the first place rather than the actual content within his sentences.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think Nelson is the better option for CMSC131. He is very knowledgable and it is clear that he comes prepared for class with examples to explain complex ideas to new programmers. Just beware of his random remarks. It is clear that he is looking for validation and wants to be liked by his students so he makes jokes on topics that students our age would find \"funny\".

As stated in other comments, he will sometimes just say jokes randomly (which can be funny at times), but as the days went by the jokes became old.\r\n- You really gotta pay attention if you don't know the material and talk to TAs constantly if you don't know anything. If anything, the TAs are more helpful than Nelson himself.\r\n- As anecdotal evidence, he created a 3rd exam (in the past there were only 2) which covered a bunch of topics. I went to the exam review and the TA told us not to review this one topic. Next thing you know that topic is on the exam!!! I heard that half of the class did POORLY on that exam (including me). I went from a B to a C overnight. \r\n- Projects are fun but require a ton of logic. I had to use external sources to find out topics that I did not understand.\r\n- Exams and quizzes are done on PAPER. You really have to know Java word by word or you are dead.

I never have an office hour with Fawzi, but the TAs are more than enough (he recruits amazing ones). \r\n\r\nThere are 3 advices to give to new students who take his class:\r\n1. DO NOT SKIP CLASS! Fawzi posts lecture slides but most are similar to outlines. To truly understand it, it's better to attend classes and see his thinking processes with examples and drawings. He is strict with time, so he prioritizes delivering all the contents he has for the lecture first then asking questions second.\r\n2. START PROJECTS EARLY! The day Fawzi posts the announcement that the next project is available is the day you should start right away! The TAs are there to help you. Immediately go to them if you don't know how to start. Don't wait until the last 4 days, unless you love being in a long queue of ~20 students (each takes like 5 minutes, give or take another 5).\r\n3. REVIEW LECTURES WEEKLY! Fawzi usually gives weekly quizzes and it's a good way to know what you need to review for midterms.

I ended up doing horribly on the second midterm and when I emailed him asking for help, he told me to meet him in his office hours. I went there and the man spent over 30 minutes with me going over my entire test in detail like what I got wrong and how to avoid falling into the traps I fell into going forward (which helped big time).

Exams are a mixed bag but for the most part, if you complete the practice exams he provides, you should be fine. If there is one complaint I have about his class, it has to be the amount of unnecessary stoppages that eventually start to get pretty annoying (like a student may not be paying attention and if Nelson notices, he'll stop lecturing for a few moments and press him/her on the spot) and the sometimes corny jokes he'd blurt out during lecture.

The biggest \u201cproblem\u201d I\u2019ve seen about Pedram in the lower reviews is that he is monotone, dry, not exciting, etc. Sure, I watched a Nelson lecture, and he had jokes and said funny things in general, but Pedram is the better lecturer. As someone who has never done CS before this class, I feel like I genuinely understand everything he taught us. He explains things SO WELL, and in addition, he draws out what\u2019s happening using memory maps (if you don\u2019t know, they\u2019re basically a tool that helps you visualize what\u2019s happening behind the scenes in code) which helps you understand just so much better (from what I\u2019ve seen, Nelson does not do that). I would come into that 50 minute lecture and feel like I was only in class for 15 min. It\u2019s genuinely incredible how interesting the class was and how fast it moved. And back to the point about him being monotone, if you can\u2019t find the lecture interesting because of that, maybe re evaluate if you should even be in CS. Any subject can be made exciting with a funny professor like Nelson, but if you don\u2019t find the lectures interesting with a \u201cboring\u201d professor, the professor is not the problem. During lecture, he would give us a min or two to discuss with our neighbors and see if we understood, which was also an opportunity to go up to him and ask a question. I only ever came up to him once, and when I did, he was so excited to answer. He knows his stuff and is excited to answer your questions (but his TA\u2019s exist for answering most questions, and the TA\u2019s are good too). However if you do need to email him about excused absences, he\u2019s very prompt. As for exams, I saw another review about how they\u2019re 8-10 pages long, which is true. But the vast majority of the exam is space for you to write your code, and most of the time you don\u2019t even need 1/2 that space, they just give it in case. If you paid attention in lecture and did well on the projects, you\u2019ll do well on the exams.

He constantly goes on tangents where he will start shit with someone in the class (usually jokingly), or explain how he has \"Nothing but respect for nurses\" for over 5 minutes (this is a real anecdote). Nelson will also explain things using superficial analogies, like stating that the \"new\" keyword is like a nurse, which is fine as a sort of mnemonic, but the issue is he never actually explains how many Java things actually function beyond that. After about the third week I didn't attend any more lectures and strictly watched lecture videos recorded by Pedram, another professor who co-taught this course with him. I have to say, Pedram did a much better job explaining things in detail and I found his lectures much more informative. Besides that basically all projects, quizzes, and exams were extremely fair in the class, and the only possible issue if you understand the subject is the time constraint on the exams.

If you don't know anything about programming, and want to seriously understand the material, I really think you should start with Pedram, as he will give you a much better foundation in the information.", "rating": 2, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2024-01-05T22:15:19.219838Z"}, {"professor": "Pedram Sadeghian", "course": "CMSC131", "review": "The people complaining about Pedram need to understand the frustration of taking other CS professors, i.e. Fawzi Emad, Paul Kline, Larry Herman. As a lecturer yes he isn't exactly the most interesting, but he gives us SOOO much material to succeed. Pedram records lectures, posts slides, gives us practice exams from previous semesters and his exams are much easier. Him, nelson, and elias basically follow the exact same curriculum when teaching their classes. I really don't know why his rating is not over 4 stars when you have teachers like Fawzi, who do not care much about his students well being and doesn't give us any practice material or any material outside of lecture, who has over 4 stars. This review is coming from someone who has taken CMSC131 with both Pedram and Fawzi so I have been able too experience their different styles of teaching, and Pedram's is by far more forgiving and has more intention to get you to succeed, while also understanding the content.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2024-01-06T01:10:46.956986Z"}, {"professor": "Elias Gonzalez", "course": "CMSC131", "review": "The class itself was really easy in my opinion.
