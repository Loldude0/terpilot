Some people say he's good because he wrote a bunch of thick books - but even those are not great. He talks down to everybody, beginning with students, and ending with his TA and fellow professors. (At the classes he talks about how other professors teaching the same class are so much worse than him, and how their slides are stolen from other people...) \n\r\nThen there's this Quadtree project, which is supposed to be written in C/C++ or Pascal. Still even though he claims to be an expert in all of them (and all Computer Science, for that matter), he constantly demonstrates he doesn't know what he's talking about. But again, according to him, everybody is wrong and only he's right.\n\r\nAt the classes, he sticks to his slides and rarely gets up from his chair. Whenever someone asks something that is not explicitly explained in there, he gets angry, saying that we're supposed to know it already. That may be acceptable if after saying it he would actually do the explanation, which of course, he doesn't (I suspect that's because he doesn't know anything out of those slides...). \n\r\nHe's paranoid about using electronic tools like the submit server or the grade server - because of this, it's hard to keep track of your progress in the class. We've just taken the final, and if we want to find out our score, we have to go to his office...\n\r\nI guess the only good thing about this course is that it teaches you how to work on your own, and not expect it to come from your instructor - in a way, it's a good life lesson... \n\r\nI wouldn't take any (other) course with him!", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2011-12-18T00:26:00Z"}, {"professor": "Hanan Samet", "course": "CMSC420", "review": "I once heard Meesh say: \"Never use a binary search tree.

So up-to-date!\n\r\nOn the first day of class, Samet spent 15 minutes comparing methods of string representation based on how much memory you can save by SHARING COMMON SUBSTRINGS. He claims to have lost the old Macintosh software that created his slides, and they're all marked Copyright 1997. You have the option of turning in your quadtree project in Pascal. So, not exactly cutting-edge.\n\r\nThe projects are all, without exception, sorely under-specified. For all of the projects the TA had to post lengthy clarifications to make the projects possible.\n\r\nRight now, the early morning (!) section with Subrahmanian is full.

Within the first couple days of class you have to turn in your specification for the data structure. Four weeks later it must be completely finished supporting 15 different operations, along with a text-based command parser, makefile, etc. All code must be completely from scratch, and you'll need to implement a linked list, a heap, and a binary search tree (heh heh) during this time to finish your quadtree. We didn't get to quadtrees in lecture until December, so you need to figure everything out by reading his 1000+ page tome. And if, like me, you escaped 216 without ever learning how to use gdb then you'll have to develop a feel for that too because it's impossible to write 2,000 lines of bug-free anything (let alone C) without a fully-featured debugger.\n\r\nMany weeks of class are wasted learning Lisp, which has nothing to do with data structures. Those projects are straightforward compared to the quadtree project, but they're nontrivial. \n\r\nThe tests are hard. For the first midterm, out of 24 exams (by the way, note that the class started out full with 40 students) 1 got <30%, 2 others got <40%, 8 others got <50%, 7 others got <60%, 6 others got <70%, 4 others got <80%, and 1 other got <90%.

He then goes off lecturing us about linked lists and other stupid structures we already learned about time and time again.\n\r\nDuring lectures, he simply reads off lecture slides which he wrote, making lecture extremely boring. He tries to engage students by calling on them randomly and asking them questions, but (unsurprisingly) people rarely ever answer them the way he wants.

So yeah, you basically learn stuff by reading the same material three times. And don't try to learn the material from somewhere else: Samet has carefully added his own opinion and bias to his course materials, and these are often important for the test.

Now imagine me, but now I am over 70 years old, very unfamiliar with very recent technology, and is paid to teach. That is basically professor Hanan Samet.

But all that matters is if he can teach college students and my god he doesn't.\r\n\r\nTaken him with online classes, his lectures were boring and barely understandable. Most of it consisted of him going through a pdf of illustrations that are hardly understandable by itself, therefore you have to watch the lecture so he can explain what it all means, but then you can't get through the dull barrier or understand at all. Also for some reason the slides and chapter pdfs given do not support ctrl+f, and this is especially bad given that these things are huge pages of text.\r\n\r\nThe big project seems to be the same each time according to the other reviews, but this time the project was split into parts with different due dates.

I've learned more on how to do the project from piazza than the pdf given. At one point, plenty of people received zero's because the hidden tests were exponentially larger than the sample ones given. Fortunately we were given a second chance to edit our project, but I wasn't happy having to edit in C of all things. They still made us use these weird huge inputs for the later parts that just makes it too difficult to debug. Oh yeah instead of using gradescope or the submit server to submit code, Samet uses Elms. Gradescope is used, but only for written homework.\r\n\r\nI should have known this professor was not gonna be good at all when the only section open for 420 was him.

Did you find the exams and major assignments fair? \r\n\u00b7 Fair exams. Mount provides practice problems with answers and past midterms.\r\n\u00b7 Midterms can be time-constrained. Pace yourself. The final exam is not time-constrained.\r\n\u00b7 Homework due before each exam, no late submission. Review each homework in the class before the exam. 1-2 questions on the exam are very similar to the homework questions. \r\n\u00b7 The exam averages range between 75 and 80, and overall, they are fair with usually one curveball question. The exam format typically consists of 30% short answer theoretical questions (multiple-choice/fill-in), 30% pseudo code, 10% drawing tree operations, and 20% theory longer questions. \r\n\u2013\r\n2. Did you feel the professor had reasonable expectations for the students in the course overall?\r\n\u00b7 4 written homework assignments, covering theory, tree operations, and pseudo code. Directly applied to the exams, 3-4 hours each. \r\n\u00b7 3 projects, 8 hours each. Straight forward with Mount\u2019s detailed descriptions.\r\n\u00b7 Exam prep, 8-10 hours. Very clear expectations, format. Do the practice problems, review the past exams and especially the homework, and go through emphasized points during lecture. \r\n\u2013\r\n3. Did you like the professor's teaching style? \r\n\u00b7 Provided a brief history for each data structure, as he had direct knowledge of or connections with the creators.\r\n\u00b7 I appreciated that the lectures focused on the essential content for exams. Occasionally, the lectures delved into theory, but Mount made it clear which theories we should and shouldn't prioritize for exams. \r\n\u00b7 Very flexible format with all recorded lectures.\r\n\u00b7 As other reviews have mentioned, there is a theoretical focus for homeworks and exams. I think some theory is necessary to think critically about using and creating data structures. If you\u2019re not a theory person, you can still succeed by doing the practice problems and reviewing relevant theoretical portions of lectures.\r\n\u00b7 The professor releases homework 1 week before the due date, but provides 2+ weeks for projects. \r\n\u2013\r\n4. Was the workload appropriate for the number of credits? \r\n\u00b7 Yes, the workload was fair/on the lighter side.\r\n\u00b7 See hourly breakdown per assignment category above.\r\n\u2013\r\n5. Was this course valuable or a waste of time? \r\n\u00b7 Valuable to efficiently work with and manipulate trees. \r\n\u00b7 Relevant for competitive interviews and working with trees in general. I\u2019ve used the concepts from this course when doing leetcode.\r\n\u00b7 Understanding how to guarantee logarithmic height in practice was the key theme in the class! We explored rotation, rebuild, split/merge/adoption, and random number generator to ensure balanced height. Other important concepts were B-trees, tries, and memory management. \r\n\u00b7 Projects taught useful concepts such as locators for tree nodes, internal/external node structure, comparators, and traversals.The 1000+ line project was a valuable exercise. \r\n\u00b7 Working directly with Mount was a pleasure because he genuinely cares about students' education and growth. \r\n\u2013\r\n6. How much support did you receive throughout the semester (office hours, extra resources, etc.)?\r\n\u00b7 Mount provided the most support among all the professors I've ever had. \r\n\u00b7 Provided fast-forwarded lectures, recorded in-person lectures, latex notes, and hand-written notes. Personally, I found the hand-written notes and in-person lectures sufficient for success.\r\n\u00b7 He answered every single question on Piazza, providing thorough responses and marking every question as a \"good question\". If you were stuck for a while, he was willing to download your submission from Gradescope and help identify what went wrong. \r\n\u00b7 He offered extensions when needed, had lenient grading policies, and allowed regrades indefinitely. He was the only professor who shared exact grade cutoffs, and regrade requests could be submitted even after the semester ended. \r\n\u00b7 Mount was always available to answer questions during and after class, and he provided extra office hours before exams. He even conducted a final exam help session on the weekend the day before final.\r\n\u2013\r\nTLDR: Mount is an excellent professor who provides fair assignments, a manageable workload, and ample resources for success. The course covers important concepts for a software engineering career. Mount's enthusiasm and experience as a lecturer make the early morning classes enjoyable. Even though lectures are recorded, make the effort to attend!

This semester is his first semester using a standard-based grading system, so if you completed all of your projects and got 100% on them, got 100% on all of the quizzes, and got a certain amount of \u201cExcellent\u201d for your \u201cexams\u201d, then you would have a guaranteed A. I really liked this style because I knew exactly what I had to complete to get the grade I wanted, and this style forces you to complete your work. There was no curve, and you were not competing with your peers which made the class feel more like a team effort.\r\n\r\nLike other reviews mentioned, he uses a flipped classroom style so you watch \u201clecture\u201d videos before class, complete a quiz, and during class, it is like \u201cdiscussion\u201d where he goes over examples of the data structure. Class kind of felt optional because it was recorded if you really wanted to review it, but he did a good job at keeping track of the notes and posting them if you wanted to reference them later. He is very friendly and knowledgable though, so it was nice to come and support in class. I found this flipped classroom style a little bit difficult for me because it felt like I had to teach myself if I was confused on how to complete the quiz, but this issue was mainly resolved by my next point.\r\n\r\nThere are \u201csoft\u201d deadlines for projects, online quizzes, and online exams (challenge problems) in the class, but you technically have unlimited attempts and until the end of the semester to get 100% on these assignments because you can request for extensions without penalty. If I was confused on how to do a quiz, I could eventually brute force the quiz until I got 100% because the question bank eventually repeats, or I could come to class to watch him do a few more examples and ask questions.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cexams\u201d were not as intimidating as they sound, and I really value Marsh because of the challenge problems. There are 4 problems to complete after each unit, and the questions still force you to understand the data structure (minus all of the theory and math that might be associated with other 420 professors\u2026). I would allocate 1-2 hours to completing the challenge problems per each unit. The final exam was also a set of 4 challenge problems. These exams were little to no stress since if I messed up, then I could get feedback (except for the final) and re-submit. \r\n\r\nThe projects were moderately difficult, but doable if you give yourself enough time and seek out help if you are dying. I would suggest following the soft deadlines that Marsh provides to stay on track because I felt like he gave an appropriate amount of time for each project. I remember he said as long as you dedicate enough time to this class, you can get an A, and I really do agree with this statement.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-12-23T17:41:24.206880Z"}, {"professor": "Justin Wyss-Gallifent", "course": "CMSC420", "review": "Overall, Justin proves to be an amazing instructor in all aspects. The grading for this course was Homework = 100, Coding = 200, Exams = 2x100 = 200, Final = 200, Total = 700. Your two lowest homework grades are dropped and your lowest coding grade was dropped (there were 6 projects in total). Homework was just testing your understanding of the data structures, including doing some proofs/calculations. Projects had you implement the data structures in Python with a possible slight twist, they weren't easy but they also weren't unreasonably difficult. All of the projects used public tests, so you knew your score immediately upon submission.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- The lectures were engaging and helpful. Justin explains things thoroughly and uploads his notes to ELMS.\r\n- As always, Justin's accompanying notes for this class are amazing. Always in full detail with rare mistakes, and contain everything you need to know for the homework, projects, and exams. If you want to take an early look at the course contents, just search up \"Justin cmsc420\" and you should find his notes.\r\n- Justin always had a review session before every exam. He explained all the concepts you needed to know for the exam, and provided a brief description of what each exam question would be about. I felt more than prepared for every single exam. The exams were fair, and he provided plenty of practice with the homework and past exams. Justin was also very lenient with project deadlines. He pushed them back if people said they wouldn't finish in time.\r\n- Grading was done pretty quickly, probably a week or so for exams. The median scores were always high (high 80s, low 90s) so there isn't much trouble there. No curve, but Justin says he bumps you if you are close.\r\n- His office hours were helpful, I only needed to go once though. The class also has a Piazza so you can ask questions there. Justin occasionally looks at Piazza, and the TAs were usually looking too.\r\n- The course content and projects are valuable and helpful for the future. Understanding data structures is important and I believe that I have a good understanding of many valuable data structures, their purposes, and how they are used.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- The only real con I have is that the final is cumulative. You have to remember a ton of content about the course, which can take a lot of prep time away from your other courses. However, you do get a notes sheet for the final, so my preparation basically just consisted of creating that notes sheet and doing all the problems from past exams. This was good enough to score well. We didn't cover all of the material in his notes, so there is some content that we missed. \r\n- People seem to say that the proofs are excessive, but I personally didn't find this to be true. The hardest proofs on the exams were basically just slight variations (or even exact copies) of proofs on the homework or the online notes. He also alludes to which proofs you need to know for the exams if you go to the lectures. If you understood why those work then you should not have a tough time. Generally speaking, yes you will be doing some amount of math but only as it applies to how the data structures work. If you seriously hate math that much, then yes maybe you are better off going to another professor. You will still have to do some form of math for this course, it's just how these data structures work.\r\n\r\nTaking this course was extremely valuable.
