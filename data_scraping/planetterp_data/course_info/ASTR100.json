She forces you to watch pre-lecture videos of her talking before coming to class (most upwards of 25-30 minutes) which you then take a quiz on. This is horrible for learning as much as she thinks otherwise. I know she doesn\u2019t believe in \u201ctraditional teaching styles\u201d but her version of teaching is terrible (because she DOESN\u2019T teach). Imagine teaching yourself and then coming to class and being quizzed everyday --- this is astr100 in a nutshell. Mind you, the grading in this course is insanely harsh.  I am a physics major taking this course for a minor and I was completely floored by the grades I was receiving in this class. She asks incredibly specific questions that ask you to apply what you know (often times trying to trick you) and will not hesitate to give you a 0/5 for a less than perfect answer. Her questions are sometimes so watered down and baby-ish that you will actually get them wrong just by second-guessing yourself. I loved astronomy before this but this professor has been incredibly frustrating. No matter how hard you study, she will never actually test you on anything but repetitive equations and hypothetical scenarios which you\u2019ve never talked about.

You have to watch a pre lecture video before every lecture and do a quiz on that. Then you also have to write a post lecture summary every time. They seemed hard in the beginning but then you get use to it. One can get a in this class, if you devote that time here. Also, I would like to mention I learned so many new things from this course. Its completely wonderful and the only class in the week which I look forward to. TAs are one the best (extremely helpful) and professor is very sweet. There are 3 midterms and a final. There is a \"retest\" paper in all three midterms where you boost your score by doing the same exam you did the classroom now at home. She usually gives 3-4 days for that, and encourages discussing with fellow students. All exams are half multiple choice and half essay types. Scoring policies are extremely fair.

The way this class is currently structured is also really nice. I took this class once before, and it has really been streamlined since then. The textbook has been scrapped, and has been replaced by online \"pre-lecture summaries\" and \"pre-lecture quizzes\". All you gotta do is watch the pre-lecture summary and then take the 8-point or so multiple choice quiz. Sounds easy enough, but it can get aggravating when the pre-lectures are easily as long as the in-class lectures themselves. Plus you gotta do the darn things three times a week. On top of that, each in-class lecture is followed by an online \"post-lecture summary\" that is related to the lecture material, but oftentimes requires you to think outside the box more.\n\r\nThe exams are also easy (I can't say much about the final, I haven't taken that yet). The attendance policy is forgiving and the lectures are by no means boring. You can tell Ms. Hayes - Gerhke is really trying to find the \"perfect formula\" for getting students to remember information. \n\r\nOne thing I wish she would stop doing is treating the class like little kids. She has a habit of stating something that is blatantly wrong, then asking \"do you agree? Or... is that not the case?\" or something to that effect. Then she waits for people to say WHY her statement is incorrect, and all the while people just sit there going \"durr... do we really have to spell it out for you? Again?\". It might just be another weapon in her arsenal of learning techniques (specifically, the weapon of mindless repetition), and if it is, I don't like it. The flash cards she uses are also kind of lame.

He was detailed and open to questions, presented organized slides, and honestly knew what he was talking about. My issue with this class is actually not him as a person, but how he set this class up. I don't believe it is set up with the success of the student in mind. In the syllabus, the grading breakdown makes sense and seems easy. However, as the course goes on, at least for me, I felt like I put in all the work I possibly could by going to every lecture and doing the graded participation, doing the weekly quizzes, and the projects (all getting high grades) and yet the midterms would genuinely throw all that work in the garbage with the class averages themselves being 60s for the multiple choice and 50s for the short answers (and then without a curve!)\r\n\r\nObviously, my biggest struggle in this class was the exams (both midterms and final). This is an introduction to astronomy class. I'm here for a gen ed, as probably half the class is too. I understood that as we went through the semester that the information being taught was cumulative and every lecture built off of each other. This caused the content to be very heavy and have a lot of aspects that took a long time to understand completely and handle all at once. That being said, the exams themselves took everything from the 100 level lecture content to a 300 level application of knowledge. I had never taken a physics dominated class in high school, which might have been my downfall, except for the fact that this class is labeled as a 100 level class and should be even ground for all students to be able to understand and apply concepts equally. Exam questions were detailed to the point where I would have to remember the exact bullet point on the exact part of my notes to even have an attempt to get it right, which to me should just not be how an exam is set up. I feel like as an intro course it should be more about applying general concepts and showing efficiency in understanding those concepts instead of giving extreme details. \r\n\r\nFor reference, I have also been a straight A student, and this is the first time I will likely be getting a C+ as a final grade in my life. And the only reason I am putting this much time and energy into writing this long review is because when I looked at these reviews during the dark time when I got my first midterm grade back everything seemed to be sunshine and rainbows and I genuinely felt gaslighted. So here's the warning I wish I had: If you love physics, possibly read about black holes, general relativity, and the very complex life cycle of stars in your free time, AND already know or have an interest in all the characteristics of every planet (and every single one of their moons!), take this class! You will absolutely love it, and might even do better than the rest of the class for the exams. I wish you the best of luck, you STEM geniuses. For those who are social science based, thought this would be an okay gen-ed natural sciences credit because the sun and the moon are interesting, and think that a nice professor is equivalent to an easy class, I'd like to see you try.
