He passive aggressively ignores Piazza posts on days the projects are due and emails from students asking for appointments (his syllabus says that he is available for that, which is a lie.)

As a senior, that's definitely saying something. Patro seems really passionate about the subject and is usually pretty responsive on Piazza, but that's pretty much where any praise for this class ends. He obviously puts a lot of work into creating lectures and slides, but the issue is that they are so complicated that a lot of students have trouble understanding the material and end up having to spend a ton of time outside of class to learn it. The course is focused on teaching a lot of different algorithms that are relevant to bioinformatics, but weirdly most of the time he doesn't actually show how they work with examples, so it can be confusing. Also, much less important but the lectures are usually very dry/boring in my opinion.\r\n\r\nProjects:\r\nThere isn't any homework for this class, only projects. He planned to give us 6 projects throughout the semester, but only ended up giving us 4 mandatory projects and a 5th extra credit project because students struggled so much on projects that he was very reluctantly forced to extend the deadlines of 2 projects. For example, the average on the first project was a 50%. It's worth pointing out that he seems out of touch with how difficult these projects are since he seemed confused by how low the average on this project was and the projects only got harder from there. His projects are also graded in a weird way where it can be pretty hard to get partial credit (hence a lot of people getting 0s on them). When he releases a project, you usually have exactly 2 weeks to complete it. Normally, this would be plenty of time to do it. However, he makes his projects extremely difficult and they take like 35+ hours to finish. Since most students at this level are taking 3-5 other classes, most of which are probably upper level classes, this is a crazy amount of work.\r\n\r\nExams:\r\nThis class has 2 midterms and a final exam. The averages on both midterms were Ds. He showed us the grade distribution for midterm 2 and according to that about 38% failed it. He gave a few practice questions before both midterm exams, but honestly they were so much easier than the actual exams that it wasn't helpful. He and the TAs didn't host any review sessions although they were requested multiple times. Personally, I found a bunch of his exam questions pretty unreasonable. From what I could tell, most students found his exams difficult.\r\n\r\nI heard a lot of good things about CMSC 423 with Pop. I regretted taking this class (with Patro instead of Pop) a couple weeks after the schedule adjustment period ended when I saw what the class would really be like.

As a side note, when writing programming projects for this class, the M space for your algorithm matters a lot! I know on Leet code or other platforms most people focus on conserving N time, but in this class you really have to think about the cost of instantiating a new string in your algorithm which could result in 20+ minutes of auto grader testing time to end up with a zero.

You will have to put in a considerable amount of effort if you take this class and that is of no fault to the professor as he does a pretty good job.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-01-11T21:45:53.227821Z"}, {"professor": "Mihai Pop", "course": "CMSC423", "review": "The good: Professor Pop is lenient with deadlines and as a student with health issues, this is very helpful.\r\n\r\nThe bad: Professor Pop gives us a choice between watching pre-recorded lecture videos or doing a reading prior to coming to class in person.
