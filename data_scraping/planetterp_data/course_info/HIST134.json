And just the way and passion with which he discussed history was so refreshing and there were times where things he said changed my entire perspective. Our discussion topics each week invited a deep conversation surrounding issues discussed in class with enough room for forming opinions and our TA did a great job of balancing everyone who wanted to talk. I will say that his final paper was very tedious, but I put in a little extra work and ended up with a 100% on the paper.
