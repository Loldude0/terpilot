That being said, I found the book to be a bit dry and ambiguous at certain points (especially the 3rd chapter) and it definitely took a lot of getting used to. Still, it's a pretty solid book (especially considering that it's the first proof based undergrad crypto textbook on the market) and Katz does a good job of following the content well.\n\r\nAnother of Katz's strengths is that he's VERY open to taking questions and will elegantly field even the dumbest possible questions you could ever imagine. In all seriousness though, he's always willing to take questions and clarify points. Given that crypto is a pretty comprehensive and complex subject this is very important and very helpful.\n\r\nNow for (what I thought were) the not-so-good aspects of Katz's teaching style. For one thing, I personally found  that the way he communicated just wasn't very easy to learn from. It wasn't just that the course was hard either -- I found that even when Katz lectured on stuff that I already knew that the message he was trying to get across was vague and difficult to wrap one's head around. It's hard to explain -- that's just how I felt about his teaching style.\n\r\nAlso, I felt that his homeworks were a huge pain and didn't really help very much to get across the content of the course. Most of the questions were taken from the exercises in the book and they took FOREVER and were graded pretty (to be frank, VERY) harshly by the TA.\n\r\nOverall, I recommend Katz for CMSC/MATH 456. I personally don't think he's the best lecturer out there but I learned a ton in his class and I know for a fact that you're going to learn a LOT more from him than you are from Fitzgerald or the other math crypto professor.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "A-", "created": "2012-12-26T01:36:00Z"}, {"professor": "Jonathan Katz", "course": "CMSC456", "review": "Professor: Seems like a great guy. He does his lectures on a whiteboard and doesn't post any notes online. As a whole his lectures are good and worth going too. He likes answering questions and will schedule a meeting with you if you need extra help (and ask for it). \n\r\nCoursework: We only had homework, the midterm, and the final. The homework's are challenging, are graded hard, and are a big part of your grade. I would recommend trying to team up with another person in class to work on them or to stop by the TA's office hours (I did neither). The midterm and the final were medium difficulty. He doesn't give any practice tests to study, so study the book and the book problems...hard.    \n\r\nGrades: He does some kinda of curve with the homework's, not sure what. The midterm and the final cut offs might be changed depending on how the class did overall. No extra work or credit will be given, so study hard for the midterm and the final. If you do badly on either, you have a good chance of failing the class.   \n\r\nBottom Line? Don't underestimate the homework's or the tests and you can do well in this class. My C grade was due to a poor midterm grade and some of my poor homework grades. This is a great senior class because of the low workload (homework's are spaced around with one to two weeks breaks in between, and you only have two tests).

He dropped the lowest one. \r\n- 2 midterms worth 20% each \r\n- The final exam was worth 35%. \r\n- 2 simple online quizzes on Elms worth a total of 5%.\r\nAll the grades were kept up to date on Elms, which is nice.\n\r\nI did go to lectures and took notes most of the time, but I felt like I took notes just for the sake of it. I never really looked over them, because I felt he was just reiterating what was in the book sometimes. He did do examples though. One lecture I realized he was introducing something we had just done for homework as if he wasn't aware of the homework at all. I suppose a TA grades it. \n\r\nThe homework was kind of easy, with a few problems requiring Matlab. He had the useful M files on Elms. I learned mostly from the book and Google...\n\r\nThe only issue was his exams. The questions were pretty tricky. None of them were really similar to any homework or previous exam. You had know the topics pretty well and even then you had to think pretty hard for a bit to try and work out some of these problems. I felt some of them were riddles really. Another thing is there were a lot of topics and cryptosystems to study for... a lot of tricky modular arithmetic and number theory involving factoring, Fermat, primality, and whatnot. \n\r\nThe final was pretty nasty. I felt like I had pretty much failed the course after time was up. It was 200 points. There were only about 20, maybe 30 points worth of problems I felt confident about. The class average for it was 108 (out of 200). \n\r\nI guess it's okay though because apparently no one got below C- with overall final scores ranging from 43% to 90%, an average of 67, and a standard deviation of 12.8 for 27 students. So it's a huge curve for this class at least. It's quite a relief because I needed this to graduate. \n\r\nIt's weird because I was really wondering.

His lectures are pretty dry and I ended up skipping most of them, but the lecture slides/textbook were enough to get me through the problem sets and midterm. Each problem set is out of 120 points, for a total of 1200 points in the category, but only 1000 of those points are counted. You could get 20 points off of every problem set and still get 100% overall, which helps a lot because the problem sets are fairly difficult. The exams work the same way, and are open note and open book. We've only had one programming assignment (in Python) so far which is disappointing. If you have strong math skills (especially with proofs) and are willing to put in the time then this class won't be too difficult. If 250 and 351 were a struggle for you, I would not take this class.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-11-07T19:57:03.580279Z"}, {"professor": "Daniel Gottesman", "course": "CMSC456", "review": "Not recommended at all, man.
