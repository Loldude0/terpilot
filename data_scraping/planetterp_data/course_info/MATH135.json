He was also really organized when teaching the class online. His lectures are decent, so I would still use them as a resource to just get an introduction to the material. They're not really helpful in getting an in-depth understanding of the material so I would not rely solely on it. He had one synchronous lecture every week which was not recorded and I did not attend that at all. For discussion, we were able to either choose to attend a synchronous discussion or watch an asynchronous recording. The times on the quizzes/exams were super flexible -- we always had a 24 hour window to complete the quizzes and the exam window was very fair (I think about 1.5 hours something like that). For the final exam, he gave us about a 34-hour window to complete it which I thought was really nice.  The textbook really helped the most -- especially the practice problems. We had quizzes once a week which were pretty difficult at times and it matters to do well because that is a section of your grade that will help you in the end. We were assigned into groups of 2/3 to complete a worksheet every week. This also matters to do well on because of the weight on your final grade. I found that at the beginning they were a breeze but they became super difficult. The best method I used was going to discussion sections on Friday to get help from the TA. Then there are \"oral exams\" every four weeks with your worksheet partner in which you attend your assigned discussion section and the TA will ask you one or two questions based on the worksheet that you did. It's really nothing at all to worry about and most of the time the questions are not math-related. They just ask about applications to the real-world. You should definitely get a 100% on all of them if you just have something to say, even if it's wrong. There is no curve in the class but this is because he drops a lot of assignments at the end which is actually a godsend. I got a D on the first midterm, B's on the next two midterms, and an A on the final. I had a high B/ low A average on the quizzes/worksheet section. I ended with an A- in the class (I had 89.56% and he rounded it without me asking!!). Overall, as you can see with my stats, if you start off a bit slow and do average on the other assignments you should end up with a good grade. The practice exam is identical to the actual exam.

I took the class entirely online in Fall 2020 and it was a mixture of asynchronous and synchronous. His lectures were pretty good, he goes through every step of a problem and provides a lot of examples. There were some times that he would seem to skip a step and he'd write something on his lecture slide that I personally had no idea where it came from, but for the most part I felt that his lectures were really organized and made sense. He had weekly quizzes on Wednesday that were usually pretty ok, sometimes they would pull some out of pocket questions at you. My word of advice would be to do the practice textbook problems. They weren't graded but they were extremely helpful for the quizzes. The only issue with the textbook problems is that Jakob never went over them himself and his TAs would go over them in both a synchronous discussion and a published video the day of the quiz. These were probably my least favorite part of the course, just because it felt like there was a significant disconnect between Jakob and the TAs sometimes; the TAs would often explain how to solve a problem in a way that Jakob didn't teach and not go over all of the problems / go over ones that weren't assigned. There was also a weekly worksheet that was done with a group due Saturday morning, and these worksheets were very hit or miss. Sometimes they were really easy and sometimes they were extremely difficult, there was no way to predict it. They also didn't always align with what Jakob had taught that week, but there was a live discussion on Fridays to go over the worksheet before it was due. The oral exams in that class were also VERY easy, every single time. For the exams, Jakob would publish a practice exam that was usually very nearly identical to the structure of the actual exams, so the exams weren't too difficult. He would also give a lot of time for them and make them open all day. Overall, not too difficult of a class at all, even for someone who's pretty bad at math.
