Iskandor's lectures are more focused on trying to be your friend since he's a grad student than actually teaching. Most of the lecture is disorganized which makes the assignments more difficult to navigate. Most of the learning I did was with the AMPs and the TAs than his lectures. I would say to skip lectures but next semester, they will require attendance which is very frustrating since it's normally a waste of time. Also, there are so many group projects and they are incredibly painful since peer reviews have never deducted significantly to change behaviors, only if they do NO work, not significantly less.

The syllabus says one date for an assignment, the ELMS page says another. HOW DO YOU NOT UPDATE A SYLLABUS?! They mess up due dates for assignments, causing undue stress for myself and other students.\r\n\r\nThe labs, quizzes, and discussions are easy As. But the homework assignments are extremely difficult. They are already complex and then the professor and TAs ignore or hardly respond to questions for help on the assignments. Then they have the nerve to grade assignments harshly. They took off 15 points just for using an exact WHERE condition just because it wasn\u2019t an allowed structure? Why take off points for an effective code. And these assignments are 25% of your grade.
