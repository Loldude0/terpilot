He doesn't post his lectures, but I think that's reasonable considering that his exams are open note, and it's easy to get notes from another classmate if you need to miss a day. Along with the open note exams, there's also about 6-8 pop quizzes throughout the course, but they're not hard as long as you pay attention during lecture (only a few basic questions about what was covered in the most recent lecture). There are a few lab assignments that are graded mostly on participation, and a term paper at the end of the course that was interesting since you get to do research on any topic you want. Not too hard overall, completing the readings probably take the most time, but they can be interesting.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-05-09T21:12:08.251934Z"}], "department": "SOCY", "course_number": "202", "name": "SOCY202", "title": "Introduction to Research Methods in Sociology", "credits": 4, "description": "The underlying logic, major strategies, specific techniques and skills of sociological research.
