Also, she is peppy and engaging during lectures which is helpful for a 5pm class. Otherwise pretty bad. \r\n\r\nPacing of assignments was way off. The semester started off with two class sessions dedicated to peer-editing and revising a single paragraph(!) and ended with three concurrent projects that accounted for 45% of the final grade. Instructions and deadlines for these assignments were not communicated until midway through the semester, well after the add/drop period. There was no semester calendar- instead we got sporadically updated handouts that covered about 3-4 weeks at a time. I also spent hours (plural!) simply locating assignment instructions and hand-in methods, since practically every one was housed somewhere different- terrible organization.\r\n\r\nCommunication was also bad. Echoing other commenters, Professor Goodson did not respond to emails or enter grades in a timely manner. There were assignments from the first month that were graded in mid-December with no feedback! The real kicker is that this professor presents early on as someone caring. She is quick to bring up the importance of self-care, checking in, and how she is always here for students. However, when other students and I came to her with legitimate grievances like illness or personal loss she was completely inflexible.

His class and rules are exceedingly simple: You do the assignments with a modicum of effort and you get an A+ in the class. (The reason I have an A and not an A+ is that I skipped a lot. Now before you sound the alarm bells over attendance!! hear me out)\r\n\r\nGrading: \r\n1. Bi-weekly discussion posts and mini-writing assignments. May seem an annoying time chore but these are graded on COMPLETION only, so you just need to write something. It's free points and takes like 20 minutes of your day. \r\n\r\n2. About 3 big papers split up into multiple sub-sections. These are graded VERY leniently (esp the drafts) so as long as you stick with the deadlines (which are fair as you have weeks to complete assignments) you will get 90+ on everything\r\n\r\n3. Effort grading. Show up at least twice for the in-class peer review (end of semester), and at least once a week. Also, make sure to provide peer feedback whenever assigned on elms and you get both of these credits for free.\r\nThat's literally it. No exams no nothing. Holmes grades pretty much everything on completion more or less as long as it looks like you tried decently well. As long as you keep up and do the work on time this is a free A. The sole difficulty of this class is just that there are a lot of little weekly assignments (the discussion posts and other minor mini-writing assignments) so you just need to remember that they exist and do them. Look at your Canvas calendar every day and you will be fine.\r\n\r\nClass Content:\r\nIt's about non-profits and as a CS major it wasn't terribly interesting or applicable to me. The content itself is also somewhat surface-level and easily learned from Google and can be seen as an intro to writing grant proposals and public relations papers.
