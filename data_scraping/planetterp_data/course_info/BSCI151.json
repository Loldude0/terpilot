Humble, down to Earth, and truly cares about his students. Answers questions in the most open way possible, you will never feel like he doesn't have time to answer your question or that your question is unimportant. Makes sure you have full understanding before he moves on. Always smiling and checking on his students between lecture slides.

Such categorizations are inextricably linked to racism, including a history of misuse in science going back hundreds of years, yet modern biological research and medicine often include the use of race.  At its core, addressing this question requires understanding the balance between genetic and non-genetic factors underlying human diversity.  The course will help students make an informed critique of the biological basis of race through the study of topics such as: basic biology, data analysis and experimental design, human evolution and genetics, and biomedical research and health outcomes.", "is_recent": true, "geneds": null}
