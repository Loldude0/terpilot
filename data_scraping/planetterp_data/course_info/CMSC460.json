His explanations can be extremely in depth and hard to follow but he does not expect you to be able to derive those explanations for yourself, just to build some intuition as to why things work. His homework\u2019s were pretty difficult but he would give out tips and answers when students were really struggling, his exams were extremely fair and very similar to his sample exams. I recommend taking this class with Dr Petersdorff.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2021-12-21T17:13:31Z"}, {"professor": "Stefan Doboszczak", "course": "CMSC460", "review": "Professor Doboszczak is a great professor. As an engineering major I have taken just a few math courses throughout my degree.... and Stefan is definitely one of the best I've had. He doesn't just go over the most basic example in lecture and give you the hardest problems to solve for homework. He gives a great balance of examples and theoretical explanations and gives challenging but solvable homework problems. He gives great practice exams and plenty of additional resources to learn the material. The only downside is that he doesn't release answer keys to the practice exams. So you should work on them well before the exam so you can get assistance from him or the TA's if you're stuck. The course, though being titled computational methods, has a lot of cool information regarding the IEEE floating point standard, how computers store numbers, and how to figure out how accurate your answer can be on a given machine (single precision vs double precision). The second half of the course I found to be more challenging as it is the more theoretical mathematical concepts you see on the course description (interpolation, quadrature, differentiation, etc). I was weary to take this class after being required to take so many math courses -- but I actually enjoyed every lecture I watched because of Stefans teaching. I would 100% recommend this course to anyone that has the option to take it.
