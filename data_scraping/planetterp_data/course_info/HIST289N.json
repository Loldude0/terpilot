I went into this thinking it would be a fun, interesting class. Instead, I was met with boring lectures, extremely harsh grading, and lack of instructions. There\u2019s not a rubric for any of the assignments in the class, yet on almost every assignment there are a ton of points taken off with no explanation as to why. Most of the assignments the high isn\u2019t even a 100, which does not make any sense. Anyways, this class has been my main source of stress this semester and makes me extremely angry.

But the professor is VERY vague about grading and we do not get a rubric for any papers. For the first half of the semester we got video lectures but once we got to the second unit on LGBT history we only got power point slides to read through.
