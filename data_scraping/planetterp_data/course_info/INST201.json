My group was only a couple hours late on one heavily weighted assignment and BAM we got a zero with no chance of pleading our case (we had a pretty good reason, trust).

It is a requirement for Info Sci but if you need an elective I recommend this since it is easy. There are two zoom meetings a week that you have to be logged into because she grades the top 20 participation grades (it's only 50 mins its not that hard). Then there's an in-person discussion once a week but it only takes like 30 mins and it's just a group activity for participation and extremely easy it needs no thought. There are weekly content quizzes based on the lectures and assigned readings (I didn't read the readings and was just fine). There are also weekly discussion boards but those are easy as well and about 150 words which is like nothing. The final for this class is a group project on a topic (kind of given to you but you choose from a list) that is 10 pages long.

To this day, I couldn't even tell you what I learned in the class. Her assignments and quizzes are unreasonable and her grading makes absolutely no sense. It's as if she rolls a die and just picks and chooses who gets what grade. She never puts in grades so you're left clueless as to where you stand in the class. Even if the quizzes were open note and the answers were literally on the slides, the answer would somehow still be wrong. While there are no midterms or a final, there are a few quizzes throughout the semester and a final deliverable. Like I said, the quizzes are unreasonable and made absolutely no sense. And the final deliverable made me feel like I was in fifth grade again cutting and gluing paper on to a trifold. I can go on and on about how horrible of a professor she is, but I think you got the idea.
