This class is a decent amount of work. There are essays, discussion board activities, online quizzes, a group paper and presentation, and final exam that all factor into the grade. You learn all sorts of various things about business cultures and how to deal with them. There are a wide range of majors represented in this class. The group project involves researching various aspects of a country one may do business in. The project isn't hard but be careful not to blow it off even though there are a lot of people in the group and it's easy to slack off your part. Also, there tends to be a pop quiz precisely on the day you don\u2019t do the readings.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "A-", "created": "2014-05-08T03:09:00Z"}, {"professor": "Darren Pierre", "course": "ENES472", "review": "Really really friendly.
