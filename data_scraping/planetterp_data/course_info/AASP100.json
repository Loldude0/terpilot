He makes every class enjoyable to the point where i can actually convince myself to go to a class. Very funny, very easy going, very nice. Cannot say enough good things about him. Take his class!",

For example, he'll say there's a quiz this week and it's not today; so u know it'll be the next class. There are three papers about 3-4 pages. Not bad to write at all and he gives you plenty of options. There is a midterm and a final. All of the quizzes and exams incorporate multiple choice and short answer. He allows you to choose between a set of dates to turn in your paper. The only down side to his class is that you really have to work hard to do well on the exams and papers. He gives out review sheets for the exams and buying the books are not necessary for the class",

I was tempted to skip a few classes since i had it at 9:30am, but his humor made me want to go.  Hes very funny and keeps you up to date on the pop culture - its very refreshing when you attend classes like organic chemistry.  You dont even have to do the readings and he gives you hints when a quiz is coming up.  Also you have 2 write 4, 2-page essays but the due dates are up to you and you can pick your own topic.  He grades very easy as well.  I barely put any time into writing those essays and the lowest i got was a 90.  As for the exams, theres only two (mid-term and final) and he gives you review sheets for both.   The exams themselves aren't that hard and if you study enough you could probably get a 100% on them.\n\r\nI would definitely recommend this class with this professor!!",

He has improved on that throughout this semester by providing powerpoints and staying within the syllabus more but still  providing us with the fun stories and allowing us to share our opinion. This class is easy if you read and pay attention. Jason is very easy to get a long with and if you ever have a problem within the course or with his teaching style he makes it clear that you can talk to him. I would recommend taking this class with Jason because you will learn things from him you might not learn elsewhere, as far as the work you do have to put in work outside of class to pass. ",

He does sometimes, but like I said, he'll go off topic. Some readings are short. Some are long. He says if you skim the reading you can pass the quiz... FALSE--unless you have no life and study the reading. It sucks when you have a pop quiz on a long reading because he asks real specific questions. He also says that grades don't matter.

You could essentially not come to class and be fine if you did the readings, but those aren't the good part of the class. The final exam dropped me from an A to a B+, half an hour for 30 difficult mc questions seemed a bit unfair. The class is great though, just don't expect to come out with an A if you don't put in a good amount of work.",

He is not a boring teacher, he's funny and respectful. The people saying that he's a \"moron\" and an \"awful teacher\" are simply just close minded people that only care about taking this class as a GENED and getting a good grade. This class is more than that and if you do decided to take one of Professor Nichols's classes he will not disappoint.",

I am not advising you to miss most of the semester but he is just a very great professor. Every time I attended his lecture he was very passionate about what he thought and if you need a history credit don't shy from taking this class with him. The semester I took him he had only 1 in-person quiz the rest I mean everything else was done online. When it comes to the class very easy class if you do pay attention and go to class but if not then everything is online/open-book so yea.",

He is a little slow with grading, but he's extremely fair and generous. The only thing I would say is to make sure you go to class because he doesn't post slides. The slides do have a lot of information, but I just take pictures of them and type them up after class.",

As if this wasn't enough to fray the nerves, the final exam is an unforgiving group oral presentation, executed without the slightest aid of notes. To add insult to injury, the professor not only grades attendance but also finds amusement in students' mistakes, openly laughing when a question is answered incorrectly. Assignments are prematurely graded, often before their due dates, and the introduction of new assignments is so abrupt that they're handed out on the very day they're due. This teaching approach is nothing short of a pedagogical nightmare.",

Dr. Nichols tends to go off topic every single class and he crams so much information into each class that it's almost impossible to keep up. I agree that he's very unorganized and I hated the way his syllabus looks. Almost everyone failed the final because there was so much information he didn't go over and he refuses to update his syllabus. Was often late to class and the class went on for so long, the material is interesting, but he just didn't make it engaging as we would just listen to him talk for almost 2 hours straight. ALSO, REQUIRED TEXTBOOK WAS JUST A BOOK THAT HE WROTE???? Do not buy -- the textbook was so pointless and just a repeat of what he said in lecture.",
