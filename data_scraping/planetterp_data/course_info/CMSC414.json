Going to class is optional, but questions on the quizzes will sometimes come from things he says during class that are not on the power-points. The actual material was usually very interesting, but there was so much material to cover most of the time we just brushed over topics without really learning how they worked. Taking CMSC456 before this class will give you a slight advantage (very slight).\n\r\nQuizzes:\r\nThere were 3 quizzes which were pretty hard. They are all short answer or diagram drawing. I felt the quizzes would emphasize a random subset of the material covered, so if you are weak on a certain topic and it shows up on the exam you are screwed. On the other hand it could not show up at all and you get lucky.\n\r\nProjects:\r\nThe projects were actually pretty fun as we got to carry out things like buffer overflows, dictionary attacks, and XSS attacks. They also more or less got easier as the semester went on. Languages used were C, Java, and Javascript. He provides resources and examples if you don't know Javascript, I taught myself everything I needed to know for the Javascript coding in less than an hour.\n\r\nFinal:\r\nIt was a little harder than the quizzes I thought. But it is only worth 12% of your grade, which was a weird concept as I am used to it being between 30% and 40%.\n\r\nGrading:\r\n5 projects 11% each\r\n3 quizzes 11% each\r\n1 final worth 12%\n\r\nOverall the material was interesting, but it seemed crammed. I think this would be a good first 400 level course as it gives you a nice overview so you can think about concentrations you would like to focus on in future courses.

In addition, he utilized standards based grading which means that there are no tests, but rather goals which are to be completed. Instead of tests, there are challenge problems which are little assignments that are very easy but make you think.  Lectures are not required (but are helpful nonetheless)\r\n\r\nOverall, this semester\u2019s version has been the most laid back and least stressful CS class I have ever taken as you can easily self pace the entire course and not feel stressed.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-01-05T19:11:01.951559Z"}, {"professor": "Michael Marsh", "course": "CMSC414", "review": "Like Marsh's other classes, he uses a flipped classroom model for 414. For Fall 2022, he did something a bit different for 414. He made all the deadlines soft, meaning he had suggested deadlines but you didn't actually have to finish the coursework until the end of the semester. He said it was an experiment for this semester, but I believe he planned on doing it again. This also meant that there were no tests. This lead to some people putting off projects for the whole semester, which I do not recommend. I think like 3/4 of the way through the semester, he said only 50% of people completed the first project. \r\n\r\nMarsh had quizzes \"due\" before every lecture, but since we had soft deadlines you could complete them at any time. The quizzes had unlimited tries and it told you what you got wrong. His lectures for some of the latter course material could be a bit tough to understand. He has to quickly explain complex topics like cryptography and networking, in order to dive into the security exploits for them. A lot of the material is tough to understand, but he doesn't test on it aside from the lecture quizzes and challenge problems (more on that later).\r\n\r\nThere were 3 solo projects and 1 team project. The first and third projects (buffer overflow and cryptography) are the hardest. The hardest part of Marsh's projects is starting them because you can be completely lost in the beginning. Once you figure out how to start them, they aren't that bad. His lecture videos don't really help at all, but he tends to answer questions for in-person lectures that help you start. The second project is easy and the fourth is a group project which is not that hard, but you have to do it in C so that makes it hard.\r\n\r\nYou had to get a 100 on all the projects and quizzes in order to pass the class, but that isn't as daunting as it seems. He gives detailed notes on the projects to tell you what you did wrong if you didn't get a 100 so you can fix it. Your entire grade is calculated by \"challenge problems\" which are scored from a scale of 1-3. These are free-response, practical questions about a module usually based on lecture material. You get unlimited time to do them, they're all online, and you are encourage to look up stuff to help with them. These were graded very leniently with most people getting full points on them. They can be a bit of pain to research, but as I said, they are graded leniently. You also get to re-submit them for corrections.\r\n\r\nIf Marsh keeps his soft deadline model for this class, I would definitely recommend it. Without it, this class could definitely be tough. I enjoyed not feeling too stressed when a project deadline loomed since I could submit it a few days later. If Marsh actually tested on the lecture material instead of doing challenge problems, I would not have done well on the tests. With this system though, the class was not that bad and I believe the average was an 85.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-01-11T23:16:19.795039Z"}, {"professor": "Michael Marsh", "course": "CMSC414", "review": "Marsh used a flipped classroom model with soft deadlines for 414, which based on other reviews is something that he does frequently. As a lecturer he is pretty good and engaging, however, I disliked pretty much every other thing about his teaching style and class structure. Soft deadlines is great on paper, until you realize that they provide absolutely no motivation to get any work done before the end of the semester, which is something that every other student I've talked to has also struggled with in this class. Additionally, it is much harder to be motivated to watch an hour worth of lecture videos than it is to attend lecture. Finally, his instructions for the projects are essentially completely useless and don't give any guidance at all. I legitimately do not believe I learned a single thing from this class.", "rating": 2, "expected_grade": "B", "created": "2023-05-16T19:46:47.329893Z"}, {"professor": "Michael Marsh", "course": "CMSC414", "review": "As you may have seen in other reviews, Marsh used a flipped classroom model for this course and made all deadlines soft for assignments. This made all assignments have a hard deadline on the last day of finals with no late penalties on assignments. I definitely appreciated this classroom formatting, as it made it a lot less stressful to get the grade you're working towards.\r\nThis class was graded off of 3 core modules: Basic Objectives, Challenge Problems, and Projects. The basic objectives were simply canvas quizzes you had to get a 5/5 on based off of recorded lecture material, and the Challenge Problems were written response prompts graded out of 3. Although you had to get at least a 2/3 on many of the challenge problems, everything was resubmittable, thus making it easy to improve upon any bad grades.\r\nThe projects of this class were not like standard CS projects you'd typically face. Most of these projects required MUCH more thinking rather than physical coding. I personally spent a majority of the time on these projects thinking it out rather than typing out lines of code/debugging. You will most likely be completely lost at first when starting projects, but one you get it, its a no brainer. To get an A or B in this class, you MUST score 100% on these projects, which is daunting at first, but the ability to resubmit as well as the fact that the projects are graded mostly off of functionality and not things like secret tests makes them more bearable. There is also a group project... and lets just say you can do it individually but finding a good group really helps with it's completion.\r\nLastly, there is a final that is 4 extra challenge problems. It is only required if you want an A or B, and isn't much more difficult than the standard challenge problems.\r\nI would say the hardest thing about this class is staying motivated. Because the deadlines are soft, it is easy to brush assignments away and let them pile up throughout the semester. I'd say 3/4ths into the semester, only about half the class had finished the FIRST project (note that by this time you should've been done with the THIRD). This will make this class BEYOND stressful for the end of semester, so if you do take this class, do yourself a favor and STAY ON TOP OF YOUR WORK.
