He does not post his PowerPoint online as he believes this will cause students to slack off in his class. You are expected to take notes by hand unless you are excused by UMD to use an electronic device. What I found most annoying was two things. He gives pop quizzes on the occasion and while they are worth 5 points, they can be unexpected and hurt your grade a little bit. The other thing is that when you are giving a speech, and you go even a second above or below the time limit, he will deduct 3 points from your final grade. If you are giving a speech worth 50 points, those 3 points mean the difference between a letter grade. Plus when you are giving a speech, you have no way of knowing the time so you really have to practice to get within a certain time frame. I will say, he did not grade that harshly on speeches and he is approachable if you have a problem. He is a nice professor and you will learn a lot in this class. You get weekly reading quizzes which aren't too difficult, and a weekly video response which if you put the minimal work in on those, you will get 5/5.

But I dont believe he actually gave someone 70 points off on a speech as someone in my class was 10 seconds under, he just silently urged them to keep on talking. He is a strict grader when it comes to presenting in general. He also has strict harsh rules, but these rules are just there to make sure you are doing your presentation correctly. People rarely ever fall outside of his rules like they are just common sense with his own twists on it basically, it's meant to encourage us to do our best. Sam is so energetic when it comes to speaking it brightens my boring day. He is always telling jokes our forcing us to tell jokes as everyone in the class must say 1 joke. (I've said 3 jokes). He seriously doesn't want you to fail and its scary the length he'll go for you just so you dont fail. At first, I thought he was doing this so that we would have no excuses when it came to our assignments. But he really just wants us to pass the class as INAG should be an easy A. It is really the exams that may hit peoples scores. I honestly never studied for them cause the questions were common sense. And I scored like 80-82 which was fine since it was above average lol. He gives us so many extra credit opportunities its crazy. The environment in his class is very comforting. The way he sets up the seats brightens my day. We can present our speech topics on anything as Sam loves creativity. He really is \"Sam the Man\" as I cannot see any teacher that can have a bigger impact than he did.

For all your speeches if you write your outline before the due date, you can email her and she will provide feedback that pretty much ensures you get 100% on the structure part of the speech rubric.

There were 4 recorded assignments throughout the semester that were very easy and didn't take too long, and other than that the only work for her class was preparing for the speeches. I didn't find her to be a tough grader and if she noticed the majority of people missed some component of the speech she would not take points off anyone for it and instead called it an error of her teaching. She randomly partners you up with people in class which might seem scary but made you more comfortable with everyone in the class and made speaking in front of them far less intimidating.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-12-13T02:45:21.904255Z"}, {"professor": "Chelsea Mays-Williams", "course": "INAG110", "review": "Great professor, understands that this is an easy class that most students are taking to cover their comm credit.
