He keeps his lectures fairly lighthearted and relaxed, and he also has a sense of humor. He, along with his TAs, are stationed on Piazza to help students with any problems or concerns, and this is very convenient and helpful. \n\r\nProjects take longer to complete than those in 131 and 132, and starting early is essential.

The amount of times he will stop the lecture just to call out a student fooling around is just unnecessary and it also distracts everyone in the class. His humor also doesn't appeal to everyone. In addition, be prepared for your inbox to be flooded with his email updates on the course material.

Otherwise I would just figure things out by myself. It was nice that he allowed laptops during lecture.

If you are one of those people that rely on compilation and debugging to see if your code works you are going to have a hard time with assembly.

I hated it. Every word that came out of his mouth filled me with aggravation and contempt. I thought he was an egotistical, straight edged jerk not to mention being completely boring and seemingly condescending to students. I was dreading the previous semester knowing that he was the only teacher for CMSC 216.\n\r\n As every other reviewer has mentioned he does in fact take attendance, force people to sit in the front, prohibit electronic devices during lecture, etc. He will also ask the trickiest, exception-to-the-rule questions on tests that are generally the difference between an A and a B. \n\r\nSome of the projects can also take a pretty good amount of time and probably average to about 20 hours or so but can be done in a lot less time with good planning/understanding. However, if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, he tends to not include some of the key details on his slides so you will not be able to get a lot of the practical information unless you are regularly attending lecture even though he says that the \u201clecture notes will be posted on line so you don\u2019t need to take notes\u201d which most students mistakenly interpret as \u201cyou don\u2019t need to come to class\u201d. \n\r\nYet as the semester went on I slowly came to the realization that he was actually doing almost all of these things to the benefit of the students. \n\r\nAs was noted in a reviewer below me noted, the no-electronic policy forces you to pay attention with the exception of an occasional text. \n\r\nPreventing students from sitting in the back gets them closer to the material and allows him to police for devices better. \n\r\nHis stringency on the honesty policy is annoying on face value, but definitely one of the most annoying things are when people who have no understanding of material get credit for things other people came up with, so his strictness could be out of respect for the students that are actually doing their own work. \n\r\nHis attendance taking is also not in the grading policy, so lack of attendance will not directly affect your grade. He claims to use it simply as a statistical study on the grades earned versus attendance, but I also suspect that he uses it for curving. For example, he will be much more likely to curve up a grade from a B+ to at least and A- if he sees that they have attended almost every lecture. \n\r\nAlmost any time a good portion of the class is in jeopardy of missing the project deadline, he will extend it even though if the whole class wouldn\u2019t have been remiss in their responsibilities as students and started even a few days earlier they would have been fine. He always assigns them with ample time in the first place. Ample.\n\r\nAlso, early in the semester I discovered that I had a scheduling conflict with the final exam and he said that it wasn\u2019t a problem and let me take it with three other people at a later date. \n\r\nI also missed a quiz and hadn\u2019t notified him or the TA until the day of and he still allowed the zero to be replaced with the average of my other quiz grades.\n\r\nConcerning the lecture material, he is good. He is always well prepared and he always drills the important parts that you need to remember. Always. Drills. Knowing these drilled points should secure you a B in the class. \n\r\nTo achieve an A in the class, Larry expects a mastery of the subject material. He expects an A to signify Excellence, unlike other classes where A stands for Average and anything below that stands for Stupid.\n\r\nTherefore, Larry is a great teacher. Anyone who argues otherwise is either too stupid to get the grade they want, or too arrogant to put in the work he requires. In short, if you are smart and willing to work, you will like him and you will do well. Or even if you don\u2019t like him, you will at least respect him, and he will do the same for you.

One of the most efficient ways to study for this class is to attend and understand the lectures - and this is only a quarter of the work.\n\r\nThis class is curved around an average of 75, despite what she might say about only ever curving 2-3% ... this is a lie.\n\r\nQuizzes - She says \"you are always to expect a quiz in discussion\" but she really only gives them about once a week or every 10 days.

If you barely passed 131/132 or had trouble on some of the assignments I HIGHLY recommend you work on projects early. These are not the kinds of projects you just sit down and burn through in a few hours like in 132, and I took the honors version.\n\r\nAnyways, Plane is a decent 216 professor, she uses the same slides as all of the other professors use and she remains fairly engaging at 9 in the morning, so that's good. She does a good deal of coding examples in lecture which helps you understand topics. I would recommend you go to lecture and work a bit on your projects while she teaches, and pay attention during the more important bits of the lecture.\n\r\nThere are six projects in this class, each with about two weeks to do. The spec for each one is drawn out and boring to read, but make sure you do, as there are a lot of hidden tricks and requirements hidden in the text. Gone are the days of private tests - 10 percent of your grade is public tests, and 75 is secret tests. You don't get to see what your project grade is when you submit - you wait a week and you get a magic score. Again, start these early. If you finish early, great, you can relax for a week and you are prepared for the quizzes. Again, this is NOT like 132. Secret tests often test a bunch of odd things (malformed input, large sample size, etc) and since you can't see the results until it is graded you can't just spam submits like in 132 until you get that perfect submission.\n\r\nQuizzes are slightly tough. If you haven't started the project most likely the material on the quiz will be brand new to you, and considering you are given 15 minutes to do a few concept questions and a programming assignment, you need to know the subject matter going into the quiz.\n\r\nLabs are the same as quizzes - if you have started the project, you should know what you are doing because the labs are a derivative of the project material of stuff that has gone on in lecture.\n\r\nTests are fairly hard, alot of programming questions, and the graders seem to love taking points off on things like syntax (I always found that rather stupid - a compiler will catch syntax errors, not logic errors). All you really need to do is look over all of the slides (posted online) before each test and refresh yourself. If you do well on the quizzes, labs, and projects up to the test, you should do fine.\n\r\nI learned so much from this class - and that's because the class moves insanely fast.

I aced 132H and this class was much more time-intensive.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "", "created": "2011-12-20T02:53:00Z"}, {"professor": "Jandelyn Plane", "course": "CMSC216", "review": "I'm going to start off by saying that this class was hard. Really hard. Probably the hardest class I've ever taken. I breezed though 132 and pulled an A easily, but 216 kept me stressed almost the whole semester and especially during the last two weeks of the course.\n\r\nThis is the review of the course:\r\n-From what I've heard from friends the books are useless, don't buy them. (I didn't)\r\n-The entire course is in a Linux environment, through GRACE. If you're already familiar with Unix commands and such, you're in luck. Unfortunately I wasn't, and this made the first few weeks using it very, very confusing. Even at the end of the course I still felt weak with Unix.\r\n-You use Emacs to code in which is OK. The debugger is complicated and I never bothered leaning how to use it. I just debugged using print statements and other little tricks.\r\n-The major topics for the course were as follows: Learning basic C, Arrays in C, Structures, Pointers and pointer arithmetic, Makefiles, Dynamic Memory, Assembly, Process Control, Function pointers, Threads, and some misc.\r\n-Both Midterms and the Final were good. They were challenging but definitely not unreasonable and tested fair material.\r\n-The quizzes, on the other hand, were plain rude. The difficulty was unreasonable, they tested stupid material, they were graded harshly, and everyone failed the shit out of them. I failed every quiz except for 2.\r\n-Lab exercises were really hard for me, and I felt like everyone knew what they were doing except me. I would recommend trying to study the material that the lab is on beforehand. It's hard to ask questions when you're completely lost.\r\n-There were 6 projects, each of them took around 10-18 hrs to complete. Projects for this class were hard and stressful (a recurring theme). I didn't need office hours at all in 132 but I went for 4/6 projects for 216. The difficulty of the projects went up for each one. Even though the projects were extremely challenging, I thought they were all semi-reasonable as long as you started early. Except for the last one. \r\n-(Mini rant) The last fucking project. Assigned literally 10 days before the final, it was easily the hardest and longest project of the year. Project 6 stressed me out so much that I felt like I was going to vomit in the coming days before it was due. (Right before the final remember) You have to pass 75% of the public tests for each project to pass the course, and I couldn't pass any of them until the day before the project was due. I tried to go to office hours all 3 days before it was due, and each day office hours had at least a 20 person waiting-list for 1 TA. I have NO IDEA what Jan was thinking. How difficult was the project to complete? Fuck if I know, I didn't even try to implement threading because I needed to study for my two hardest finals that were the first day of finals week. \r\n-Overall the course was VERY fast paced. Looking back I definitely learned a ton from the course, but I didn't really have time to get a thorough understanding of all the topics.\n\r\nThis is the review of Jan:\r\n-I'm giving Jan 4 stars mainly because I think her current rating of 2 is too low. \r\n-Jan is a very nice person and a pretty good lecturer. She has a good grasp on all the material and knows what she's talking about. It's not too hard to pay attention in class, there is just so much material that it's easy to instantly forget a lot of it.\r\n-The format of the class is a bit boring. Powerpoint lectures.\r\n-Some of the powerpoints are not well done and confusing. You really need to pay attention in lecture to figure out what's going on. Especially the powerpoint on Assembly, which I thought explained Memory very poorly.\n\r\nAdvice:\r\n-Go to class, study before the Lab Exercises and quizzes.\r\n-Start the projects as early as you can. I wish I hadn't procrastinated some of them.\r\n-Make a couple friends and talk about the projects together. Yeah it's technically against the rules, but it will keep you from going insane when working on the projects.\n", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "B", "created": "2011-05-24T01:25:00Z"}, {"professor": "Alan Sussman", "course": "CMSC216", "review": "I'm giving Sussman 5 stars because honestly, he's one of the better professors in comparison to the other CS professors in this department.\n\r\nIt is hard to pay attention in lecture because he doesn't make things very interesting (although, an intro computer science course will never be that interesting).\n\r\nHowever, he for sure knows what he's talking about, and he definitely explains things thoroughly.

This is a good thing for those who can get a conceptual grasp of the content, but for those who are just here to code, it will be considerably difficult. Many students took to watching Nelson's lectures from previous semesters after the move to online because Yoon's lecture style proved too difficult to keep up with for some without being able to ask questions as they came to mind. Taking the time to understand Yoon's lecture style did prove very useful and I felt I learned quite a bit from the course overall.\r\n\r\nYoon's exams are tricky for similar reasons. Unlike Nelson, who will usually make his exams based around high-level understanding with code, a lot of Yoon's questions felt like tricks. There was a \"catch\" of some description in almost every coding question across all three exams, which can be annoying if one detail causes you to lose many points.\r\n\r\nYoon (and moreso Shankar) unfortunately did not do the best job of transitioning to the online environment after COVID-19 began making its rounds. I think they were unprepared for the scope of what they had to transition to, and as the semester progressed both got fairly crass. I don't hold this against Yoon too much, however, because the transition was hard for everyone.\r\n\r\nOverall, I'd recommend Yoon if Nelson is not teaching the course.

So for starters his lectures are very dry, this may be due to online semester, I do not know completely. I may stun a lot of people by saying this but I believe his exams in terms of content are quite fair, almost all the topics are touched upon in the review guide and I was never like \"oh wow i have never seen this before\". \r\nNow the problem with his exams is:\r\n1) Multiple choice questions with like e options where there are multiple answers and say you picked A and D when the Answer is A and E, you would in that case gain 0pts because when you pick a wrong option, you lose points.\r\n2) He made us install lockdown and join a live zoom call, now I understand why he does this, but its important to note how extremely intrusive lockdown browser is\r\n3) Every exam has a 50pt \"find the error\" type problem which is great if you find the error, but obviously if you cannot, there goes 50pts on a 200pt exam\r\n\r\nNow that isnt the only problem with this class. His projects have almost 1% weight in the class. For the hours of work required to finish these projects, they have almost no significance on your grade at all.

Not to mention there is NO Piazza, so I can see how easily it is for students to fall when they do fall because their is a lack of help. The TA's also are most of the time complete and utterly useless when it comes to project help, not to mention the wait times were quite long.

I even got lecture zoom links for times when I was in other classes, so I couldn\u2019t go. The rest was watch the lecture videos which are posted roughly 8-16 hrs later. Worst experience ever, literally COULDN\u2019T go to live lecture for a whole month. Had to schedule other classes around finding time to watch lecture videos whenever they got posted out of the blue, screwing up any relative organization of my classes. He often cuts of students asking questions and just says come to my office hours. No Piazza, cannot email him and regular office hours with TAs are a mess.

Can only submit up to I think it was 6 times before you were penalized. Have to run tests using Grace. Oh that\u2019s another thing, the super ancient system and the way that everything is taught using emacs. Just use vscode. There should be a document floating around about how to set it up. Content wise they are fair ngl. The project descriptions are about 10 pages long so I\u2019d say 95% of common errors and edge cases are explained. If you follow the documentation and code to covers those cases  the projects will still be hard but you will be fine passing the public tests and probably some of the secret tests. DO NOT procrastinate on them. They are weighted incredibly low so they do jacksht for you grade. \r\n\r\nExams: These are basically the do or die of this class. I think majority of averages were around 68%, with one at 56%. The way you have to answer the multiple choice which pretty much usually has more than one answer is super stupid. Let\u2019s say there are two answers out of 5. Suppose that A & B are correct but you put down A & C and, so the points gained and lost for that question equal out to zero, so it is like you never attempted the question. You have to be super confident to get points on these because any incorrect answers will lower your grade. Don\u2019t even try to guess on these questions because you will just hurt your grade. If that wasn\u2019t enough there is a question at the end which takes the longest, but also in a sense is a simple you get it or you don\u2019t.

He essentially makes attending lectures mandatory because of the unannounced classwork. He is a stickler for the rules, like having KN95 mask instead of the generic blue mask (last semester when it was mandatory). He puts a password for all his attachments which is really inconvenient. His projects are probably the hardest among any other classes I have taken and the deadline is not generous (compared to other classes at least). His lectures are extremmmelllllyyyy boring. He essentially didn't curve at all last semester for like the first time because of \"over-performance.\" He doesn't like being called a professor because of the technicalities of the word (lol). I could go on and on about him.\r\n\r\nBut when you take the other CS classes, you'll start to appreciate him. The biggest issue I have with the current CS classes I take is the inconsistencies in practice content and real exam content. The cheating that goes around doesn't make things any better. In this respect, Larry Herman is tough but fair. Occasionally, yes, you'll get a question that you would not know if you strictly did the practice exam, however, this was rare and often would not take you down too much in points. Also, the amount of time he gives for his exams is more than enough. For the final, it seemed like more than half of the people finished early and left.\r\n\r\nAlso, Larry rarely makes grading mistakes, at least not to the degree other professors do. For the current classes, I am taking, to put into perspective, I have to make a regrade request almost every single time. I only had to fix a mistake with him once. \r\n\r\nAdmittedly, as one of the reviewers here pointed out, I have learned programming outside of the class. And if I didn't have prior experience, I probably would not be as successful in this class, or at the least, I would have had to put more effort to achieve the same result. But honestly, if you genuinely have a passion for coding, that is the only way you can possibly succeed in this major for the average person. And if you have a genuine passion for something, you should have prior experience. And even if you are just here pursuing a CS major for the bank, you gotta admit, there is no CS lecturer fairer than Larry Herman. \r\n\r\nOf course, because I mentioned his flaws with him at the beginning, I had to take a star away. I wish he was a bit more lenient in many respects than I listed above; trust me, I'm not happy that he did not curve grades at all when I took 132 with him. But when you advanced further into the CS major, you'll soon come to realize what a privilege it was to learn from a fair person and the things you complained about are minor inconveniences that even have some sense to it (for instance, he wants people to come to class so learning is more effective, hence unannounced classwork).

This was incredibly surprising considering there was never a time crunch for exams, but I guess his exam writing skills don't translate over to the quizzes. \r\n- As a principle, I despise professors that require students to show up. We're paying to be here, it should be on us to go to class. I skipped discussions because my TA was incredibly useless, typically mumbling to himself the entire time as if he's never interacted with another human being in his entire life. Near the end of the semester, Yoon decided to grade (as put by another review on here) \"nothing\" assignments at every discussion. Typically, it was a small worksheet that would take about 15 minutes that would cause us to leave incredibly early anyways. Complete waste of me and every other students' time that would have been better spent working on the projects. \r\n\r\nOverall, avoid him. Definitely a passable class, just be prepared to put in WAY more time into the projects, exercises, and studying than you're used to from 131 and 132. The only reason he gets 2 stars instead of 1 for me is a) he's completely oblivious to the way his course design tortures students outside of class and b) the exams are pretty fair. Best advice: review all the slides and take notes outside of class, and START PROJECTS EARLY. I don't mean just early, like the literal hour they are assigned. You will typically end up having a time crunch with the deadline if you don't, especially near the end, and you absolutely need the project grades to boost your overall grade in the class.", "rating": 2, "expected_grade": "B", "created": "2022-12-17T15:18:31.255200Z"}, {"professor": "Ilchul Yoon", "course": "CMSC216", "review": "Yoon's CMSC216 is the first CS class at UMD that I've felt lost in.

However, lectures are recorded, and they are watchable when you pause every once in a while to really understand what he's saying. The quizzes and exams' tested materials are mentioned in lectures or at least referred to, but they're often lost in a mountain of additional info that never got mentioned again or seemed very insignificant. The first quiz was a disastrous time crunch, but he hasn't made the same mistake again in my opinion. Office hours were always full, and attendance was suddenly graded halfway through the semester. Attendance grading was very superficial and felt more like an annoyance.  All in all, I wouldn't recommend Yoon as a 216 professor.

No, those quizzes needed at least 25 minutes, and they were always tricky for no reason. \r\n\r\nThird, he gave us zero time for our projects and exercises. We had due dates one after the other, nonstop. We would have a project due date, followed by a quiz the next day, followed by an exercise due date.

Yoon thinks that we live and breathe 216. \r\n\r\nLastly, he is very much not lenient. We had a due date for one of the projects the day after Diwali. We all know that a good chunk of computer science students consists of people who celebrate this festival. Students were on piazza begging for just a one-day extension for the project, and his TAs were so rude with their responses. Yoon didn't even bother to acknowledge any of these pleas. He probably expected his students would prioritize a CS project over their religion.\r\n\r\nApart from all of this, there's also the fact that he's a terrible lecturer. He used the tiny ESJ whiteboards in a giant lecture hall on multiple occasions. I was sitting in the middle and I could barely see what he was writing. I could work past that if I at least understood what he was trying to say, but the man cannot get a point across.

I'm giving him 3 stars because he is a genuinely nice teacher who wants to help you (especially if you go to his office hours). I also noticed that progressively through the semester, he made his incredibly difficult quizzes slightly easier, learning from student's complaints. Quiz 1 and 2 were incredibly difficult, but the last few quizzes were arguably easier than the other professor's quizzes and were a bit fairer. He started off writing some content on an incredibly small white board, but listened to student complaints and shifted to projecting onto the large screen. His practice questions were also pretty good practice for his exams, despite what some people might say below. You just have to study ALL practice tests, not just one, to have the best chances. At the end of the day, he is a caring professor so I'll give him that. BUT, his lectures lack a lot and it is very hard to follow him sometimes. You have to be prepared to put in a lot of extra work and try your hardest in this class. It has to be your top priority if you want to get an A or B. That being said, here are some tips for this class: \r\n\r\n1. Always try to start studying for quizzes and exams A WEEK before (Every quiz and exam MC or Short Answer may have tiny details that will be found from the large amount of slides that are posted on Elms). You NEED to go back to each and every slide and try your best to understand and remember what it said on each slide. You will not get away with two days of studying unless you absorb every lecture well, which is not likely to happen.\r\n2. CODING EXAMPLES and PROJECTS. The coding examples that are done during lecture or labs are insanely helpful and amazing practice for coding questions on quizzes and exams. Some coding examples or project codes are very close to what you will see on this examinations. If you practice the codes from your projects/exercises and lecture examples, you will do fairly well in coding questions. \r\n3. Go through every year of Practice exams provided. Before midterms we were given practice exams from multiple years. Focus most of your energy on the coding practice for this exams, but short answer and MC are great too because if you are lucky, they may reuse some former questions. \r\n4. START PROJECTS ON THE SECOND OR THIRD DAY (or first day if you really want). We are college students and sometimes we have better/more important things to do than starting projects and finishing them quickly. But, some of the projects released for this class have very difficult public tests and even harder release tests. The good thing is that they enforced an early deadline for the first two public tests for each project and usually if you passed the first two tests, you might pass almost all the other tests. Using this early deadline to your advantage is crucial because if you pass all public tests at the first deadline, you will have more time for release tests and office hour help. DON'T make the mistake of starting release tests very close to the final deadline because you won't get much help from the TA's who will have their office hour schedule filled up from other students. \r\n5. Rewatch Yoon's lecture videos after reading his lecture slides. This was a big one for me since I learn better by reading content and then listening. Yoon's lectures are very hard to follow in person (for many people) and I often zone out in his classes, absorbing nothing. This is what causes many people do perform poorly in this class. They don't go back and rewatch the lectures which can actually be great supplements to the lecture slides (which I'm guessing is most people's only resource for content studying). Now, I'll admit that I did not rewatch every single lecture because I did not have time, but for concepts you are very confused in, I recommend it because Yoon does have some good info in lecture if you actually pay attention or look back. \r\n6. BE PREPARED TO SELF-TEACH AND HAVE DISCIPLINE: You need dedication in this class and you need to actually care about it to do decent in the class. You need to set schedules for yourself to code up the projects and you need to try to make some attempts to attend discussions because some can be very helpful. During the Assembly and Processes unit of 216, it was mandatory to attend discussion. Many students were not happy about that but I think it fared well for them in the end. Those concepts would be incredibly difficult to understand by just reading the lecture slides and I'm sure many students would have failed those portions on the Final if they were not forced to attend discussion. In my honest opinion, discussion was very helpful during the last couple months when they made it mandatory (it was a bit \"useless\" earlier which is why many skipped).\r\n\r\n\r\nAll in all, if you care about this class and prioritize it, you can most definitely get at least a B (especially with the curve at the end).", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-01-18T20:32:46.830298Z"}, {"professor": "Larry Herman", "course": "CMSC216", "review": "Had Larry for 132 as well so I went into this class knowing what to expect, and it was exactly what I expected.\r\nPros:\r\n- Good lecturer\r\n- Answers all questions\r\n- Covers content well\r\n- Well organized\r\n- By the book\r\n- Old fashionedish professor that is very straight forward\r\n- Knows his stuff\r\nCons:\r\n- Sooooo boring\r\n- Is not generous with points\r\n- Attendance is part of your grade", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "A-", "created": "2023-01-19T20:45:26.613735Z"}, {"professor": "Ilchul Yoon", "course": "CMSC216", "review": "Don't take this professor at all. terrible. only take as a last resort. basically, ur grade depends on the curves and all u can do is pray and hope you pass or you dont", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "", "created": "2023-01-22T02:59:02.578107Z"}, {"professor": "Ilchul Yoon", "course": "CMSC216", "review": "Not an awful person.

While the questions on the exams are tricky, you will be fine as long as you pay close attention. There are no surprises on the exams.\r\n- He wants you to do well. Even though he is hard to reach and can be terse at times, he really does want the class to do well. He gives tons of practice work through ungraded homeworks, graded projects, and huge practice exams before the real exam.\r\n- Extremely well structured. All the assignments for the entire semester are laid out very clearly on ELMS. All the projects and exams are very clear on what he wants you to answer.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Difficult to reach. He does not supply his email to the class. The only way to see him is after class or in office hours (with a mask on), which he will sometimes cancel unexpectedly. \r\n- Dry lectures. His lectures can seem very boring and dry, but they are very informative. He often repeats himself multiple times (this is when you know it will be a question on an exam)\r\n- No electronics. He does not permit phones, computers, or any electronics in class.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-05-07T14:21:19.467783Z"}, {"professor": "Larry Herman", "course": "CMSC216", "review": "Lectures:\r\nPros: Incredibly important and dense. If you get these, you should pretty easily pass the class.\r\nCons: Incredibly boring, and dense. A genuine struggle to listen to because of how sleepy it can sometimes be. I have ADHD so sometimes I want to just run out of the lecture hall. If you don't pay attention, you are going to hurt your grade significantly (My grade suffered a lot). It's genuinely really difficult to pay attention.\r\n\r\nProjects(Huge part of your grade): \r\nPros: Each project comes with a file that basically tells you exactly how to do it. If you follow these, you don't need to think a whole lot about what to do. Lots of bonuses if you are diligent.\r\nCons: Each project comes out right after the other, so it's a neverending grind. There is always barely enough time to get them done, if you slack off you will be tweaking the last few days. The projects are still pretty hard and debugging them is very pinpoint. And the TAs can be hit or miss. \r\n\r\nExams:\r\nPros: He gives out practice exam material that is very lengthy.\r\nCons: Really hard, really specific details you can only get from the lecture or the textbook. Sometimes the grading is insanely harsh. I still haven't really cracked the code on how you are supposed to do well on these(I've basically failed both). The practice material is (as he says) a good metric for how much you actually know. You still need to extensively study after that.\r\n\r\nOther things to know:\r\n\r\n1. There are a lot of attendance-based worksheets that are 11% of your grade. The TAs are pretty cutthroat with these so make sure you attend and have an excuse or two.\r\n2. The office hour system is awful. Too many people and not enough TAs. When we switched to Quuly, I literally waited 6 hours in line before I got help.\r\n3.

They take forever to release grades and most of the time all grades aren't released until late May (they were just released today).

By the end of the semester he entered some more grades, and my grade dropped to an B+, and now he has entered all grades, I have dropped to a C+.

Herman doesn't seem to know this and only really only tested us on material he had rushed through for the last couple weeks of class. This exam was much harder than the rest and the average was an D+, and the worst part is that he refuses to bump up grades, even if you are on the edge (89.5, 79.5, etc.). \r\n\r\nI would still recommend Herman though since he is your best option.

His lectures are explained thoroughly and he tries to spice them up with some occasional larry humor or interactive demonstrations. (Touching and piping students :3)\r\nHis slides however are relatively barebones due to him heavily explaining them with lecture. Since he doesn't record his lectures this means that skipping lectures and going through the slides is NOT a good idea. Thus attending lectures is something you should do, or at the very least get notes from another student. Discussions I felt were pretty useless, but he does have attendance worksheets for both lecture and discussion so make sure that if you skip, you know there's no worksheet.\r\n\r\nProjects:\r\nHis projects are extremely well-detailed, which is both a pro and a con. He provides a clear understanding of what you need to do and how to do it, but sometimes the project descriptions are so long that you miss one or two instructions in there due to the sheer size. Overall though I think his projects are quite fair and decent to complete. Sometimes there's up to 6% extra credit for the projects too which makes it even better. \r\n\r\nExams:\r\nHis exams are.... hard to quantify in difficulty. Generally, his exams will only test you on concepts clearly discussed in class, so there are no surprises in there. However they are often very specific about small topics sometimes, so if you fail to study for 1 small niche thing you may end up with an abysmal exam grade. For example, you might have a test that only covers ~40% of what you learned in the lecture, so even if you studied the other 60% you might still do bad. Simply put, his exams cover certain things more heavily so you gotta study everything or get lucky. Additionally, extra credit on exams is pretty sparse depending on the question type. This combined makes it tough to get a high grade on the exams generally, but they are fairly decent to earn a \"passing\" grade. This is made especially better due to the fact that he gives extremely thorough practice tests. The question types are identical usually, but the actual exams just change up the weighting of what's covered on the exams. For example, a practice exam might be 30% about process control, but the exam might only have 10% about that and the rest be about something else. Either way, though the practice exams are VERY helpful and are ESSENTIAL in doing well on exams.\r\n\r\nPersonality:\r\nThis is where people often hate Larry the most. He can come off as rude or abrasive at first because he has some very strict and thorough policies required for you to meet with him, and what you can and cannot discuss. Follow these and you'll get along fine. Don't follow them and you will get thrashed. It is what it is. While definitely annoying, I rarely had to contact him for anything so I never experienced a thrashing. Be warned\r\n\r\nOverall tl;dr\r\nLarry is a good instructor with one of the most organized classes I've ever seen. The difficulty comes with tough exams so it may be hard to clinch a high grade, but passing Larry is something that you will be able to do as long as you put in the effort. The class is hard, but very studyable. For reference in my semester, the class avg was ~82% compared to the overall 216 avg of 2.45 GPA.

Most of the grades for this class were released in the last WEEK, and the final exam grade was published TODAY. I do not know why it takes so long for grading to proceed in this class and I never know if I am doing well enough in projects because it always takes so damn long. You'll think you're at a good standing in this class because your percentage has stayed pretty consistent, but then you realize half of the class' grades aren't even published.\r\nAt the very least, in terms of material, the lecture slides are okay with what you need to remember, but it can be frustrating to keep up with them because they can be very lackluster in coverage for certain topics, and it can take a hot second to remember what the slides are talking about if your notes weren't the best. They assume that you have gone to lectures and have paid proper attention (which is a fair assumption to make), but they also assume that what they cover clicked immediately with students, and it was especially difficult this semester to go back to slides because for some reason Herman decided to abandon recordings for 216 where in 132 recordings helped a lot with going back to material that I did not fully get. The slides are decent, but not always good enough to go back to review what materials you may want to go back to.\r\nWhere Herman's class succeeds, there's way more that frustrated me and it comes from how his class was overall structured, and a lot of issues that he had from 132 in Fall also carried over in Spring. I'd recommend taking Herman anyway though, because out of 216 instructors (at least this last semester) he's overall the best one, but keep in mind that his class may be unreasonably frustrating due to how bad it can be at keeping up with how students do.", "rating": 2, "expected_grade": "A-", "created": "2023-05-28T22:33:23.588804Z"}, {"professor": "Larry Herman", "course": "CMSC216", "review": "This is just a list of thoughts, so sorry if its somewhat convoluted.\r\nThe topics covered individually are not difficult at all, its just the sheer amount of content there is that may be overwhelming.\r\nLarry teaches the material very well, but he is very boring, enough to make you fall asleep (real).\r\nHis project descriptions are long but helpful in covering all the secret tests as long as you read through them (I recommend using the highlighter in Adobe Acrobat).\r\nHe has a somewhat built-in curve through worksheets graded for participation, but beyond that he really doesn't curve grades at all.\r\nHis exams were both fair and unfair depending on your perspective.

I liked him a lot because his teaching style meshed with my learning style well, but I see why others would dislike him. I personally think he's great.\r\n\r\nPros: Really planned class - what he says in class and what the TAs say in discussion is what's on the exam. Answers all your questions, and well - if he brushes you off during class, wait until after class or office hours to ask again. I asked him the same question like 4 times after class because I didn't understand, and he was very willing and even said he would change what one of his slides said to stop people being confused in the future. TAs are great too, all the ones I've had experience with were really smart and willing to help. Projects are graded fairly and style is made clear. Project assignments are *exceptionally clear* and I was never confused on what to do past just a little information overload at times. Worksheets are a free 10% of your grade - show up, try, and you're already 1/10th of the way there, and the feedback is quick and TAs will help you understand the answers. Again - main pro for me was that he was really willing to answer questions after class.\r\n\r\nCons: Project grades take ages to come back - really annoying at times. Exam grades are not much better, but they're a little more reasonable. Exam multiple choice is punishing - he really will ask about that one thing he mentioned that one time, then take 6 points off if you don't know it. He expects you to take notes on only what he's saying then go to the slides after class to take notes on those, but that's stupid and bad and doesn't work, and so you will have to give yourself carpal tunnel to keep up in class. He is also really *not* accommodating for absences, even for sickness, which sucks.\r\n\r\nTips: Lectures and discussions are *must attend* - missing one when you have friends who take shitty notes is really hard. The lectures are information-packed and you must know all of it - exams are very likely to ask you about a specific topic that he mentioned that one time. If you have a slow note-taking speed, yikes, he speaks a lot and quickly and it's all informative, interesting, and on exams and projects, and he *will not* let you use a computer/tablet to take notes unless you are very good at hiding it and he does not notice (or you have accommodations). He will tell you to read textbook chapters (optional and required). *Do* read and take notes on the ones he calls required - that, or have a friend who does and lean on them for the worksheets that rely on that info (i was that friend. it was okay but also I really think that's not a very reliable method of learning and my friends rarely seemed to \"get it\" - I am not a teacher haha). I never read the optional ones and I was fine, but I assume that if you can't keep up notes-wise with everything he's saying in class it would be helpful. The first exam is also always worth way less than the others - I got a C- on my first 132 exam (went to it sick. do not do that.) and still finished the class with an A, although with a lot more effort than I would have usually needed to put in.

For example, Larry and Yoon teach assembly with MIPS, whereas we get AVR.  I don't know MIPS much at all, but for one it has an explicit frame pointer unlike AVR, and I believe they have to learn about stack frames right off the bat, whereas we learned it as a subtopic during the last week.  I still don't know how frame pointers work in assembly, as we really didn't go over it at all, but I could probably learn fairly quickly by the time I take ENEE350 next semester.  It's still a whole lot better doing AVR assembly than going into ENEE350 blind like most EE's do.\r\n\r\nHonestly though, that's a minor nitpick compared to the benefits it gives.  For one, Nelson's exams aren't hard in the slightest.  They're like Pedram's, but much easier.  The averages for the three semester exams ranged from 87-91%.  For the most part, they're pretty fair in not testing crap no one cares about, and when it does pop up on occasion, it's not worth a whole lot of the exam.  Most of the weight are in the coding questions, and they are pretty easy.  If that's not enough, Nelson gives us so much review material.  For exams 1 and 2, he gave us material dating back to 2014.  For exam 3, he gave us a ton of process worksheets and quizzes.  The final review material was a bit lacking, as nothing really covered threads all that well, but that's minor if you could understand exercise 6 and actually watched the lecture videos at the end.  Even then, the final was only worth 10% of the grade, so if you did well on everything else it's nothing to worry about.\r\n\r\nThe exercises and projects were kinda neat, but it was kinda back to back to back on that front.  Just, please work on them early.  If you get stuck, especially if you can't go to in-person office hours, virtual office hours were pretty crowded this summer by the project due dates, so go early.  You may lose some secret test points here and there as I did, but if your implementation is mostly correct, it shouldn't be a big issue regarding your overall course grade, granted you do well on the exams.\r\n\r\nIf you do take this course over the summer and want to do it mostly asynchronously, as Nelson set up another section just for this, just please don't try and take advantage of Nelson.  It will not work.  Piazza was kind of a nightmare this summer, and part of that was due to requests like \"can the lowest project be dropped,\" despite the grading scheme being clearly laid out in the syllabus at the start of the semester.  Nelson laid out from the beginning of the semester that this is a very demanding course, and he cannot grant extensions for arbitrary reasons (he is very lenient about extensions and whatnot when it comes to genuine issues unrelated to workload).  Unless you have plenty of experience in C and assembly, you will likely struggle at some point in the course, so start things early.  Even worse, do not attempt to cross Nelson by cheating.  He is not lenient at all about academic dishonesty, and he will request an XF if he has any proof of someone cheating.  He has the terms laid out in the syllabus like just about every CS professor.\r\n\r\nIf you can pick things up semi-quickly, and you don't flood yourself with other responsibilities, you will have a good time in this course.  Nelson said at the beginning that if you do your part, there's a good chance you'll get an A in his class.  It's certainly doable to take this alongside either another class or a job/internship, but just know that the class doesn't slow down because you're doing that.\r\n\r\nOverall, with some of the horror stories I've heard about 216 (particularly with Yoon), this class was nothing like that.

Considering the test average for my class is 62, you should focus on completing every problem rather than making sure every problem is correct, so you can get saved by some partial credit. Most of my friends have left full pages blank on exams.\r\n- Take the projects seriously. If you care about being a good programmer that is literally all that is important. Don't cheat on them, or if you do at least make sure you understand what you are copying. Without this I guarantee you will fail tests.\r\n- TAs take upwards of a month to grade tests and projects.

His lectures can be a bit boring, but he explains concepts fairly well and most of what you need to know is in the textbook. His projects were pretty difficult and time consuming for me, but they definitely helped me understand the material better, so I think they were worth it. Exams are fair and he provides a lot of practice questions in his study guides. Attendance in lecture and discussion is kinda required since he sometimes will have graded worksheets that all together were worth 13% of our grade, but you would get 100% for just trying on them and they give a large boost to your overall grade if you do all of them. The main complaint I have about him is how long he takes to grade things. He gave us our midterms back after maybe 2-3ish weeks, but we didn't get most of our project grades back until after the final, so it was kinda hard to know what my grade was for most of the semester which was a bit annoying. I guess if you're confident in the material it wouldn't be so bad, but the week after the final before I knew my final overall grade was pretty stressful since I didn't know where I was grade wise going into the final. Overall, Larry is a pretty good professor, but the time he takes to grade things just add even more stress to an already pretty stressful class.", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "C", "created": "2023-12-24T01:42:52.139634Z"}, {"professor": "Ilchul Yoon", "course": "CMSC216", "review": "Ended the course with an A-.\r\nLectures & lectures slides in my opinion are top tier.

Heard that Yoon's projects are better than Larry Herman's. Ended up submitting one project late. Discussions are basically mandatory to attend, you have a lab worksheet to do almost every lab. Yoon or one of the TA's responded within a day on two on Piazza, which was awesome. Midterms & Quiz, this is where Yoon is cut-throat. Midterm1 mean was 66%, Midterm2 66% FinalExam 58% Quiz1 75%. Note the median is probably a good bit higher, as the mean is affected by outliers. At the end of the semester the Median: 77 Upper Quartile: 85 Lower Quartile: 68.

Based on my approximations the curve was more than 2.62% but less than 6.62%. \r\nReflection: I also don't like how toxic curve based classes can be as you are competing against your peers for that curve.

In short, I think the main thing you have to do in this class is invest a lot of time and DO NOT PROCRASTINATE. This goes for not only projects but just understanding what Yoon goes over in class. This is honestly a lot easier said than done, as Yoon's lectures are really hard to understand often. However, not making sure you understand the material will likely just force you to catch up during later lectures or projects, and in my experience just made the class much harder\r\n\r\nProjects and exercises are honestly (somewhat) fair but they take many, many hours (don't do them last minute). While yes, the MCQ for tests is kinda rough, I honestly think the free response isn't too bad given it's much easier to get partial credit; however, I think in order to FRQ you really need to get acquainted with your labs and the examples given in class. I often threw on many MCQ questions, but free response helped pad my grade. \r\n\r\nFinally, there are some point buffers that made the class (mildly) more bearable, mainly in the graded lab work that was introduced in the middle of the semester. I'm not sure if Yoon had this in previous semesters, but it gave a 15+% buffer of free points that really helped improve grades. \r\n\r\nI think this class overall isn't totally unfair if you can put a lot of time in (besides the test MCQs), but you really need to be prepared to spend hours upon hours each week.", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-12-25T04:26:45.511983Z"}, {"professor": "Larry Herman", "course": "CMSC216", "review": "Pros:\r\n1.

The fact that he is able to bore everyone to death to the point that when I look around and everyone in the back is asleep is honestly pretty impressive. He not only fails to be a good teacher, but he also fails to be a decent human being. He has no interest or care for the students and treats them like objects. Despite the large class size of 600, I have witnessed many professors handle an equivalent load with less arrogance and impudence. Larry has the tendency to over complicate simple concepts. His project descriptions span an average of 10 pages containing repeated or unnecessary information and claims that tools such as the debuggers are essential, when many including myself do perfectly fine without it.

He is very understanding of your circumstances and is ready to give you a make up or extension whenever you need it without asking for much proof or reason. I was personally super excited to have him for 216 since it has been a while since he taught the course in a normal fall/spring semester. I have realized I made a big mistake of taking him when I realized how his class is all over the place and gets way overly distracted. I appreciate the jokes, but it gets to be too much when I am just trying to learn the content. Like I genuinely haven't ever learned anything from his lectures whenever I go to them. I only learn from watching his summer lectures, in which he explains things better and more seriously. He expects us to watch videos from his lectures back in the summer, and then expects us to come into class somewhat knowing the material and lectures are more like a review session, which I really don't like, because I will sit in lecture for 75 minutes unable to concentrate because he will either talk about something I have no idea about, or go on a tangent about love lives idk. Like personally I do not have the time to watch entire lectures from previous semesters on top of lectures we have in person with all my other classes. Now let me get into the real reason why he's only getting 2 stars....HIS PROJECTS. Oh...my...god, the descriptions are so bad and confusing, and his third project genuinely made me want to cry. Not only does he assign projects, he also assigns exercises, which are like mini projects every week. So we generally have an exercise and a whole project in the same week. And the projects aren't even cool creative projects, they are just plain way too complicated not well described projects. I had heard that Yoon has similar projects to nelson which goes to show how awful they are.
