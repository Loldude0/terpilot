Going to lecture is a MUST because she gives A LOT of notes that are not online. Like most African American studies class, there is a lot of reading.

He was responsive to concerns and questions that everyone else had, and he made sure to communicate any schedule changes ahead of time for adequate preparation.

I took this class in the fall and some of the assignments from October were not graded until Thanksgiving. \r\n2) He assigns a lot of readings. It's not too overwhelming, but as someone taking 2 math classes at the same time, it was a little much in terms of a personal workload\r\n3) Lectures can get a little dry in the latter half of class.

She assigns a lot of work and expects you to refer to her documents to know what is due and when it is due, but she had the dates from last semester on her documents so you couldn't know when stuff was due. She also moves her class onto zoom after a couple weeks which is annoying for a class where most of the class time is spent discussing course content. Also, right now we are two weeks from the last day of classes and she hasn't given a grade on any assignment. She also wastes a lot of class time.

It is WAY too much work for an intro level 200 class, I have never had this much reading expected of me in a class. Dr. Grant-Wisdom is so focused on if students read that she spends all of her time in class trying to catch someone who didn't read so she can expose them. Her slides are unorganized, she is constantly late to class, and it took her a month and a half to grade an essay that was worth a large chunk of our grade. She does not care about her students, she argues with them in class, tries to prove people wrong and call them out, is rude, and frankly not a good teacher. She has slides with quotes, which she uses to lecture, but constantly goes off-topic and gets very confusing. She has called students stupid and belittled them for not knowing things when she has been wrong about things but refuses to change her mind. She kept threatening to change the virtual final to an in-person one because she felt students were cheating and was so worried that she is trying to change the 'hybrid' aspect of the course. The worst part is, she was not even supposed to be the instructor. We were supposed to have Dr. Newby by Dr. Grant-Wisdom was asked to take over and she is trying to change aspects of the course that do not need to be changed. She does not care about her students, is extremely closed-minded, and is SO focused on us cheating that she is policing us and almost expecting us to cheat when no one has.

Only thing that was frustrating was how he did not answer emails, and took a long time to grade. He was kind of a little boring too, and the class size diminished as the semester went on.

As someone who reads for fun outside of class, I got really good at skimming through books, which is an extremely helpful ability in this class. You will be okay to miss a couple of readings, but if anything, go to class. I feel like a bulk of the content is reviewed in class by him anyway, so even if you are behind in the reading, the lectures will help you catch up.
