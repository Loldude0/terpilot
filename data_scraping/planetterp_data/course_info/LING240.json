Dr. Bleam is an amazing professor and LING240 is such an interesting class! She's an excellent teacher and her lectures are engaging and helpful. You will need to read articles/studies/experiments for this class but they are always interesting and understandable. The exams match material discussed in lectures and on exercises and homeworks, both in content and difficulty. They definitely supplemented my learning and did not feel like busywork or a waste of time. \r\nI honestly found the class to be easy and scored very well on the assignments and exams with minimal effort. HOWEVER, my classmates said they found the exams to be somewhat difficult and that the TAs were picky graders, so maybe it depends on whether or not you have a knack for this kind of thing. Either way, getting an A or B is totally doable if you are willing to put in at least a moderate amount of effort. My best piece of advice is to take notes during class AND on the readings. Nothing exhaustive but make sure you have all the key points and some examples. \r\nI highly recommend this class, especially if you're genuinely interested in linguistics.

A slight drop in your score and your grade will go whoosh and it is VERY DIFFICULT to raise it again. A+ cutoff was 99%, even though the GPA is the same for an A as an A+, I just found it strange.\r\n2- This class is not an easy elective, especially if you have no prior knowledge of linguistics: DON'T take the course unless if you're really passionate about it and be prepared for it to be very abstract.\r\n3- Her demeanor with students: this fluctuates. When it comes to something besides questions about the course or material, she is nice and understanding. But to me, and for many of my classmates, her reaction when you ask a question can sometimes feel degrading and make you feel stupid.\r\n\r\nThis is my own experience, just my raw opinion without sugarcoating.
