Also, I didn't want to harm this professor because, at times, she seemed nice, but my final grade just got on my last nerve. If, by any chance, professors read this source, Dr. Salako will immediately recognize me. Still, for the sake of expressing my true opinion and concern for future generations of students, I'm writing this anyway.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I'm not the type to write nasty reviews or harm anyone, even if I don't like something. However, since Dr. Salako chose to be \"fair\" (I'll explain later what I mean), I'll fairly rate her and express all my concerns. First things first, the course itself is incredibly confusing and unstructured. As of Fall 2023, the only class she had was ENGL101x (for international students), and all these reviews are dedicated to this course. We had a small group, around 15 people, where everyone knew each other, so the communication between students was very well-established and I am absolutely certain that every single student shares the same opinion about this professor. Everyone in this class was misled and confused all the time. I attended every single lecture, even when I was sick with a fever. I listened to every word she said, did all my homework, and asked a lot of questions. However, asking questions proved useless; she either wouldn't answer or would confuse you more. Even if you argue with her and your whole group tries to prove that what she's saying doesn't make sense, she would never admit it.\r\n\r\nShe tries to pretend to be a nice and caring person, but she won't give you credit for classwork if you didn't come to class, even if you did it at home anyway (assuming that you have a legitimate reason, like severe illness with proper documentation). One time, I had been writing a paper all night and had an exam the next day. I submitted my paper and realized there was one more thing to do for homework. It seemed logical to me to submit the second small task to the second submission attempt. I left a comment indicating my paper was in attempt 1, and the second task in attempt 2. During the lesson, I got a grade for a paper that was a zero. Confused, I asked Dr. Salako what was wrong, and she replied, \"I only check the second submission attempt.\" I apologized and explained my mistake, suggesting she could make an exception since I indicated in comments that I made a mistake, and she could easily access the first submission. It's not a crime, and I am the only one who made this mistake. Yet, she insisted on giving me a zero. I went to the bathroom, started crying, came back not looking good, and she told me not to cry in front of the front group. She said I could still get a good grade for a second draft, but I tried to tell her that giving me a zero is not fair since she knows I did the work and submitted it on time. She didn't care and continued saying things that made no sense, with the whole class watching. After class, she insisted on me staying in her classroom and telling her about my problems (she was convinced that I was actually crying about some \"family issues\" and not about the paper that I had been writing for 6 hours straight). The further conversation is rather private, but I can say she made some untactical comments about me.\r\n\r\nYes, she is called \"sweet\" by another student in this comment section only because she is hardly trying to sound and look like such; her voice and manners seem very nice. But, in reality, she doesn't care about her students, proven by that story and by giving out zeros to sick students who do their work even with a fever.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I worked my ass off in this class; as I mentioned earlier, I did absolutely all I could possibly do. Still, I got a B. Honestly, I'm a stem major, and I've taken classes that are traditionally supposed to be much harder, but I didn't get a single B, except for this one. The class ENGL101 is not hard itself, but she made it the hardest class I've taken. There were kids in this class who were much smarter than me, but they dealt with the exact same issues that I did. I highly doubt that anyone got something above A- (I might be wrong though), but I am pretty sure that the majority was shocked by their final grades. She didn't do any curve, didn't adjust any cutoff, she did nothing even though she had a class of very smart  and hard-working students who were always attending lectures, paying attention in class and trying their best (almost everyone in this class was acting like that and was actually taking this class seriously!). So, since she decided to be \"fair\" to us, I am being absolutely fair and honest about her. DO NOT TAKE DR.SALAKO! unless you want to make your life a living hell.", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "B", "created": "2023-12-23T03:29:12.703093Z"}], "name": "Olubukola Salako", "slug": "salako"}
