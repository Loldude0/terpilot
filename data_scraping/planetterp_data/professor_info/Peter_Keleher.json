In my opinion there's nothing to worry about. Yes, there are times when he gets a little impatient with people, but to me it didn't seem any more extreme than any other professor. His responses on piazza were always curt, but I feel like most professors give super short/curt responses that could be seen as rude when it comes to written communication. \n\r\nAs far as teaching style, he's your average CS prof. Go to class, he pulls up slides and goes through them. He seemed to actually care whether or not students were understanding the material as he would stop and check often if people were keeping up. He would also encourage people  fairly often to ask questions. \n\r\nIn my case, it seemed like any of the few signs there may have been of him not enjoying teaching the class stemmed from the lack of class participation when he would encourage it (which was often) so he would be left talking at us, or there would be a dialogue between only him and a couple students.

Going to class is optional, but questions on the quizzes will sometimes come from things he says during class that are not on the power-points. The actual material was usually very interesting, but there was so much material to cover most of the time we just brushed over topics without really learning how they worked. Taking CMSC456 before this class will give you a slight advantage (very slight).\n\r\nQuizzes:\r\nThere were 3 quizzes which were pretty hard. They are all short answer or diagram drawing. I felt the quizzes would emphasize a random subset of the material covered, so if you are weak on a certain topic and it shows up on the exam you are screwed. On the other hand it could not show up at all and you get lucky.\n\r\nProjects:\r\nThe projects were actually pretty fun as we got to carry out things like buffer overflows, dictionary attacks, and XSS attacks. They also more or less got easier as the semester went on. Languages used were C, Java, and Javascript. He provides resources and examples if you don't know Javascript, I taught myself everything I needed to know for the Javascript coding in less than an hour.\n\r\nFinal:\r\nIt was a little harder than the quizzes I thought. But it is only worth 12% of your grade, which was a weird concept as I am used to it being between 30% and 40%.\n\r\nGrading:\r\n5 projects 11% each\r\n3 quizzes 11% each\r\n1 final worth 12%\n\r\nOverall the material was interesting, but it seemed crammed. I think this would be a good first 400 level course as it gives you a nice overview so you can think about concentrations you would like to focus on in future courses.

They were, however, very independent. We had to learn the tools and technologies on our own. We only had high level concept discussion of the project in class. This created difficulties with debugging the gRPC code and goroutine concurrent code since we had no experience/lecture on this and no office hours. \r\n---\r\nDid you think the professor had reasonable expectations of the students in the course overall?\r\nExpectations were somewhat reasonable. Come to class having read the paper and done a blog post. Start projects early and ask for help as needed. The RAFT consensus algorithm felt unreasonable. He linked the paper and asked us to implement it. There was minimal help or scaffolding for this one.\r\n---\r\nWere you a fan of the professor's teaching style?\r\nPete\u2019s guiding philosophy is to learn by doing. 80% of the grade came from projects. There were 6 main projects plus part of the final was a project. The projects are in Go and use gRPC. \r\nDuring class, Pete read docs with key points of each paper. The lectures weren\u2019t as helpful because they were not as structured and lacked examples and exercises to deepen understanding. It was too high level, especially having just read the paper. The last 4-5 weeks are student presentations of papers. \r\n---\r\nWas the workload appropriate for the number of credits?\r\nProjects were on the heavier side. First couple projects took 5-10 hours, but the last few took 10-20 hours (anti-entropy and RAFT consensus especially). When this was combined with reading two papers before each class also took 1-3 hours each week, the workload got quite heavy. I felt like I wasn\u2019t doing justice to the papers I read\u2026 I wish there were fewer but more in depth papers.\r\n---\r\nWas this course a waste of time or was it beneficial in some way?\r\nI thought this course\u2019s projects were beneficial. Projects are super relevant to distributed systems. Go and gRPC are marketable skills. I had the opportunity to present verbally for 20-25 minutes. \r\n---\r\nHow much support were you given throughout the semester (office hours, extra resources, etc.)?\r\nPete was responsive over email and Piazza. He would have terse replies. He was willing to download your code and help you locate the bug. \r\nOne time, I was stuck on a project and asked for office hours. He answered every other Piazza post except for my request for office hours. Minimal office hours.\r\n---\r\nTLDR: I think the projects of this class are worth it if you\u2019re interested in distributed systems. They\u2019re complex covering topics such as data chunking and blobstore, server client in gRPC, crypto signing and verification, anti-entropy, fault tolerance consensus, and transactions on a shared log. I will say the projects are largely unrelated to lecture, so you\u2019ll have to do a lot of independent learning to complete them. The lectures are relevant to system design interviews if you take initiative to develop an intuition for the ideas.
