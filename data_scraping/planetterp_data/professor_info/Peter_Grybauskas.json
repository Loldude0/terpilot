As a con, I guess he isn't always super clear on what he's looking for in his assignments. But if you just ask him questions in class he's always willing to guide you.

(as he claims is his nickname) is an awesome dude. Doesn't give a ton of unnecessary assignments - main focus is on a few big papers that will be spaced out very well across the semester. He loves (and studies) J.R.R. Tolkien and lots of his writing, so much of the content is based upon Tolkien's work. I had no idea who Tolkien was before this class and probably won't ever engage with his work in the future, but Prof. G did a great job of explaining Tolkien's writings and made it really easy for us to write about his works. Sometimes the guidelines for assignments can be vague, but if you ask him or shoot him an email he is always willing to help/explain. If you are more reserved/introverted sometimes classes can be awkward because he hosts discussions on occasional readings, but he doesn't dock your grade if you're shy or anything. He's a super goofy dude and loves joking around in class. Definitely cares about his students and their well-being. He's a very laid back guy - the type of guy that I'd want to hang out with outside of class.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-05-04T15:53:56.513278Z"}, {"professor": "Peter Grybauskas", "course": "ENGL101", "review": "Prof. G is very smart and pretty funny.

Not because he's some genius at teaching or because he changed my life but because he understands the class that he's teaching and acts accordingly based on what his students want to get out of it. ENGL101 is a very easy class and most students in it only want to get their credits and be done. Prof. G understands this and makes the class suitably easy for the students on top of being a legitimately passionate and engaging lecturer when he does give lessons in class. He has a real love for Tolkien and medieval English literature and through his speeches on the material I was able to appreciate a little bit of it as well. He's not a very consistent teacher, quite a few classes are just free time to work, he was absent for 4 lectures over the course of a semester and is sometimes overly energetic when speaking. But this just serves to make the class less of a time sink for students with harder classes and makes it more fun when engaging subjects are actually covered.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-08-12T21:38:25.981382Z"}, {"professor": "Peter Grybauskas", "course": "ENGL101", "review": "Prof G, really understand his students and is one of the best professors I had.

This was a unique kind of professional writing course that was specifically held during the winter, where our writing assignments were based around the work of J. R. R. Tolkien. A good chunk of the workload was simply reading the Lord of the Rings, and our assigned writings were mostly creative assignments that were open-ended (no stressful research papers). Every assignment felt meaningful and relevant, and he was on top of responding to emails if we had questions about the assignments. We had a few zoom meetings where he enthusiastically talked about Tolkien's life and his writing, and where we also got a peak into a study abroad session in Oxford, U.K. I don't know if this course will be offered every year, but if it is being offered and you don't mind spending some extra money to knock out your professional writing requirement during the winter, I could not recommend it more. Even if you're not a book fan, you will definitely enjoy this course more than most other professional writing courses.
