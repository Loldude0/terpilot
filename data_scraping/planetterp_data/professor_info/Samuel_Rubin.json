This was by far the most interesting and fun class I took in the fall semester and I'm glad for once that we have to take a comm gen ed. Similar sentiments as others where public speaking can be hard for me but this class was still my favorite. I saw a big improvement by the end of the course not only on my speaking but also with my pre-speech anxiety. I honestly spent a lot more time and stressed more for the first one than I did on my last one. A good amount of people seemed to not enjoy the lecture parts in the first half of the semester but I actually really liked them because I enjoy this content and its a break from what I learn as a STEM major elsewhere. He also tells us what to write down for notes which I enjoyed. He honestly is a great guy and you can tell he truly cares about his students. He's a little eccentric which can be annoying on days you feel tired but I wouldn't have had it any other way. Since class size is so small and we spend time learning about others, by the time class ended it really felt like a family (cheesy ik but I mean it) and I was actually kind of sad when it ended. His wife also makes baked goods for us the first week of each month.\r\n\r\nOnly \"complaint\" I have is that since he kind of teaches his own way you do have to look at the textbook for the midterm and final even though we never use it before then. We also got short take home quizzes that were things we didn't cover in class but the textbook had. I don't believe comm107 has exams so if that's a huge dealbreaker for you take comm instead but inag exams are fairly simple (I studied way more than I needed to and finished the midterm in 5 minutes and got a 98 on it) but comm107 will just be another gen ed you have to take and nothing like the experience inag gives you. Inag exams also are worth very little, mid term is 5%, final is 10%, speeches are the bulk, and he's a pretty lenient grader in my opinion. Some of my other friends took inag with other professors some of which seemed WAY harsher and another that I heard was maybe chiller than Sam (he has a few things he's strict on but they're very easy to follow and he reiterates them all the time), but none of them understood the connection we left the class with (and I say this as someone who didn't talk as much in class).

Boring parts are not what he chooses to do but what he has to by the curriculum and he makes it tolerable through stories and letting us introduce ourselves in this early part of the class. One slight downside is that he doesn't teach the difficult parts of the midterm + final exams very well, but the majority of questions are easy (4/5 easy questions, last fifth was strange questions) and these are a small part of the total grade anyway. He is a very lenient grader for speeches, giving as many opportunities as possible to give more points if he can, and as someone who had many issues with stuttering, he gave me more points than I think other instructors would have given. On days we don't present we get to sit back and review one other person's presentation for the day, which meant it was a nice time to chill but also learn from others. I got to know about other people, from their names to interests to ideas, which is more than I could say compared to basically all my other courses at this campus.

But I am going to list the cons first. He grades speeches probably the harshest out of the other inag professors. As someone mentioned being like 5 seconds under a 5-minute speech will result in 70 points off of on speech. But I dont believe he actually gave someone 70 points off on a speech as someone in my class was 10 seconds under, he just silently urged them to keep on talking. He is a strict grader when it comes to presenting in general. He also has strict harsh rules, but these rules are just there to make sure you are doing your presentation correctly. People rarely ever fall outside of his rules like they are just common sense with his own twists on it basically, it's meant to encourage us to do our best. Sam is so energetic when it comes to speaking it brightens my boring day. He is always telling jokes our forcing us to tell jokes as everyone in the class must say 1 joke. (I've said 3 jokes). He seriously doesn't want you to fail and its scary the length he'll go for you just so you dont fail. At first, I thought he was doing this so that we would have no excuses when it came to our assignments. But he really just wants us to pass the class as INAG should be an easy A. It is really the exams that may hit peoples scores. I honestly never studied for them cause the questions were common sense. And I scored like 80-82 which was fine since it was above average lol. He gives us so many extra credit opportunities its crazy. The environment in his class is very comforting. The way he sets up the seats brightens my day. We can present our speech topics on anything as Sam loves creativity. He really is \"Sam the Man\" as I cannot see any teacher that can have a bigger impact than he did. If you are looking for a fun class to actually better your speaking skills take Sam. If you are just looking for a class to just get a grade and dip, take anyone else. I hate public speaking, but I can definitely say I learned a lot from this class. I have seen improvements from my first speech to my last speech. INAG is not a hard class in general.
