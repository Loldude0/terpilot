You should attend somewhat though, there is a 15 percent contribution category, I don't think they actually evaluate that though, I would still show up most of the time, but if you don't really feel like going you won't miss too much. Other than that the class is pretty simple, there is a slight curve at the end, if you do badly on any assignment, just ask her if you can make revisions to it, she is very accomodating. I got a 79 on the culture audit the first time, then I asked if I could redo it, emailed her why I should deserve a regrade, and emailed her my revised copy, and got an 89 on it.

This is one of the worst classes I have taken so far in college. I feel like I have learned absolutely nothing, and Professor Brindle made it almost unbearable. She is extremely passive aggressive and disorganized. She expects you to take notes in class but her lecture slides are completely disorganized, don't actually say anything important, and she moves too quickly to take notes anyway. What I find most ironic is that she is teaching a class about how to be a good leader, and yet she embodies none of the leadership traits she teaches us about. She is extremely braggy and definitely has favorite students and students she dislikes, and she makes it clear who falls in which category. She and her GA also refuse to submit grades on ELMS for some reason, so no one has any real idea of what their grade is in the class. SOMETIMES we get emails with feedbacks and scores on papers, but not always. While she may technically be qualified, this is not the type of person you want to learn about leadership from. I am excited for this class to be over. I feel like I am walking out having learned nothing, been extremely bored and drained mentally, and feel even less confident in my leadership abilities than when I walked in on the first day.
