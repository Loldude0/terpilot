First is that, being a theoretical physicist whose career is based on quantum mechanics, he is a bit too good at the concepts in this class. So he would often go over material too quickly for everyone to understand it. \n\r\nAlso, he was frequently out of town so we would often have a substitute which was not a horrible thing but I kind of like consistency. \n\r\nHowever, my biggest problem was his grading. He gave several quizzes throughout the semester and one of those was the day before Thanksgiving. How many people go to class that day? He also refused to let people make the quiz up.\n\r\nOn both of the midterms, the front page said you have 2 hours to complete the test. We had 1 hour classes. So pretty much no one finished the tests and the grades reflected that. Even if we had had enough time the tests were incredibly difficult and the grades still would have been awful (virtually all the questions were incredibly difficult unless you knew some obscure math trick).\n\r\nThese poor grades are reflected by the grade distribution. I think that over 60% of the class got a C or below, including about 1/4 of the class getting D's or F's. In my opinion, that is an absurd distribution that reflects an awful grade policy. \n\r\nThat said, he was good about answering questions so if you knew what you didn't understand you could ask for help easily  enough. But I really didn't know what I didn't know until after the tests.", "rating": 2, "expected_grade": "C", "created": "2013-08-14T16:03:00Z"}, {"professor": "Sylvester Gates", "course": "PHYS411", "review": "He explains things well and knows the material extremely well. On top of that, he's a friendly guy who's willing to help his students in any way he can. He had this one inspirational lecture that actually made me want to go home and do some physics.\n\r\nHe's an award winning physicist, which is great, but this means that he travels a lot and misses a lot of class. When he isn't in class (which was in total about a third of the semester), he has one of his two post docs teach the class. As a result, the class material gets really fragmented. This is the main reason I'm not giving him 5 stars.\n\r\nHomework takes forever and tests are difficult, but this is no reason to downgrade him.

We didn't even get the syllabus until the second week. The course is an awkward mismatch of history from the late 1800s to WWII and surprisingly advanced nuclear physics. The math and science part was not taught well, especially in a class with students with no physics experience. The lectures were essentially Prof. Gates muttering to himself (he doesn't know what a microphone is) about random history and science things (a lot of which were irrelevant to the course). The TA seemed nice but was very awkward and was not good at teaching us the math we needed. We also have no way of knowing our actual grades since they're not posted accurately on elms or by his office. The only good thing about this class was that the grading was pretty fair.

He knows so much about everything he talks about, and he comes across as a very compassionate professor. That being said, the lectures in this class were not particularly captivating. There's a lot of history in this course that I wasn't anticipating--I thought it would be a lot more science based. Dr. Gates clearly has a passion for both history and science. He's so knowledgeable about both, but he doesn't seem to realize that the rest of us are so far below his understanding, so most of the information goes in one ear and right out the other. Overall, this gen ed is way more stress and work than its worth, and I would not recommend it unless you're incredibly interested in WWII and the Manhattan Project. If you only like nuclear physics and aren't a fan of any of the history (like me) I would not recommend it.\r\n\r\nAlso, Dr. Gates will often post test material on Canvas with the expectation that we print it, which is kind of inconvenient if you don't have a printer. The library printers can be a little sketchy. We're allowed to make a formula/cheat sheet for most quizzes and the midterm exam (there's only one midterm). Dr. Gates said that the cheat sheet likely won't help us no matter what we put on it, and he's right--the quizzes are on the most random stuff that was either briefly mentioned during the lectures or not mentioned at all. When we ask what we should study for each quiz/exam, he directs us toward all of the lecture notes from the semester, which are often unclear. The averages were usually low Cs or high Ds.

With such a wide breadth of material, tests were pretty difficult for a GenEd, and this wasn't helped by the fact that outside of midterm grade updates I had no idea what my grade was in the class. From what I've heard from the non-STEM majors the mathematics aren't exactly easy for people not already familiar with electricity and magnetism (though no actual calculus was required), and our T/A, while nice, wasn't good at explaining stuff (half of a discussion section was arguing with people whether the cross-section of a sphere had surface area 2\u03c0r^2 or \u03c0r^2). The term paper is fair but a little irrelevant to the course material (it's basically \"did you read the Rhodes book\", the assignment).

The class definitely could have been organized better but personally I think Professor Gates' teaching made up for the disorganization. Overall I'd say this class is definitely not easy or light work so make sure you're actually interested in the content (nuclear physics AND wwii history).

I'm writing this review just before the final and I know that I got a 77/100 on the midterm. However, he grades are based off an average, which he does not release. So I don't know if that grade is a C or an A. The same goes for quizzes. There's also a term paper, so be prepared for that, but he won't release information about assignment effectively. The topic can be about essentially everything, meaning he gives no guidance for what to write about and he provides no format for the style the paper should be written in.
