He loves to talk about his wife, dogs and his band. He can be sarcastic and doesn't always give clear instructions, but he is overall a nice guy, and will let you re-do your work until you get an A. Plus, learning InDesign isn't hard. I would recommend this class. Best Part: No homework (except sometimes a little news reading for quizzes, but they are really easy).", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2010-12-13T00:42:00Z"}], "name": "George Lanum", "slug": "lanum"}
