The lectures do not coincide with the projects, so for more than half the projects you'll be looking at text books learning the material to execute the projects. Marsh will release public test scripts to test your projects but they typically don't work, causing everyone stress by having to submit their project blindly. His testing scripts would also typically screw up on the projects causing many students to request regrades, which they wouldn't receive back for months later. In 2 instances, information in the project description was either wrong or misleading, which caused due dates to get pushed back. This would be fine except Marsh did not compensate the rest of the schedule. This caused the biggest project of the semester to be given a week less to complete.

This is nice becuase it makes class optional becuase its just a session where he goes over examples and lets people ask questions (no clickers or no material taught, so you can skip if you know the material).

I thought that the projects were fun, and that Marsh really wants his students to succeed in the course. He is always responsive and willing to help out and give feedback. Marsh himself is your most valuable resource in this course, I think. I highly recommend 414 in particular, but I would recommend Marsh as an instructor for any other course as well. I would absolutely take a class with him again.

He said it was an experiment for this semester, but I believe he planned on doing it again. This also meant that there were no tests. This lead to some people putting off projects for the whole semester, which I do not recommend. I think like 3/4 of the way through the semester, he said only 50% of people completed the first project. \r\n\r\nMarsh had quizzes \"due\" before every lecture, but since we had soft deadlines you could complete them at any time. The quizzes had unlimited tries and it told you what you got wrong. His lectures for some of the latter course material could be a bit tough to understand. He has to quickly explain complex topics like cryptography and networking, in order to dive into the security exploits for them. A lot of the material is tough to understand, but he doesn't test on it aside from the lecture quizzes and challenge problems (more on that later).\r\n\r\nThere were 3 solo projects and 1 team project. The first and third projects (buffer overflow and cryptography) are the hardest. The hardest part of Marsh's projects is starting them because you can be completely lost in the beginning. Once you figure out how to start them, they aren't that bad. His lecture videos don't really help at all, but he tends to answer questions for in-person lectures that help you start. The second project is easy and the fourth is a group project which is not that hard, but you have to do it in C so that makes it hard.\r\n\r\nYou had to get a 100 on all the projects and quizzes in order to pass the class, but that isn't as daunting as it seems. He gives detailed notes on the projects to tell you what you did wrong if you didn't get a 100 so you can fix it. Your entire grade is calculated by \"challenge problems\" which are scored from a scale of 1-3. These are free-response, practical questions about a module usually based on lecture material. You get unlimited time to do them, they're all online, and you are encourage to look up stuff to help with them. These were graded very leniently with most people getting full points on them. They can be a bit of pain to research, but as I said, they are graded leniently. You also get to re-submit them for corrections.\r\n\r\nIf Marsh keeps his soft deadline model for this class, I would definitely recommend it. Without it, this class could definitely be tough.

Several of my friends needed \"skills tests\" appointments (basically a live coding, open book quiz you take 1 on 1 with a prof or TA). He accomodated so many that I'm honestly surprised how he found all the time. Marsh also responds to piazza fairly quickly, for the majority of the semester. Marsh also provides hints in project descriptions about what concept to use to implement that part of the project. His projects are very fair. Not too easy, but not insanely difficult. This class was one of the few classes I walked out of thinking I had developed a real world skill.

This made all assignments have a hard deadline on the last day of finals with no late penalties on assignments. I definitely appreciated this classroom formatting, as it made it a lot less stressful to get the grade you're working towards.\r\nThis class was graded off of 3 core modules: Basic Objectives, Challenge Problems, and Projects. The basic objectives were simply canvas quizzes you had to get a 5/5 on based off of recorded lecture material, and the Challenge Problems were written response prompts graded out of 3. Although you had to get at least a 2/3 on many of the challenge problems, everything was resubmittable, thus making it easy to improve upon any bad grades.\r\nThe projects of this class were not like standard CS projects you'd typically face. Most of these projects required MUCH more thinking rather than physical coding. I personally spent a majority of the time on these projects thinking it out rather than typing out lines of code/debugging. You will most likely be completely lost at first when starting projects, but one you get it, its a no brainer. To get an A or B in this class, you MUST score 100% on these projects, which is daunting at first, but the ability to resubmit as well as the fact that the projects are graded mostly off of functionality and not things like secret tests makes them more bearable. There is also a group project... and lets just say you can do it individually but finding a good group really helps with it's completion.\r\nLastly, there is a final that is 4 extra challenge problems. It is only required if you want an A or B, and isn't much more difficult than the standard challenge problems.\r\nI would say the hardest thing about this class is staying motivated. Because the deadlines are soft, it is easy to brush assignments away and let them pile up throughout the semester. I'd say 3/4ths into the semester, only about half the class had finished the FIRST project (note that by this time you should've been done with the THIRD).

There was no curve, and you were not competing with your peers which made the class feel more like a team effort.\r\n\r\nLike other reviews mentioned, he uses a flipped classroom style so you watch \u201clecture\u201d videos before class, complete a quiz, and during class, it is like \u201cdiscussion\u201d where he goes over examples of the data structure. Class kind of felt optional because it was recorded if you really wanted to review it, but he did a good job at keeping track of the notes and posting them if you wanted to reference them later. He is very friendly and knowledgable though, so it was nice to come and support in class. I found this flipped classroom style a little bit difficult for me because it felt like I had to teach myself if I was confused on how to complete the quiz, but this issue was mainly resolved by my next point.\r\n\r\nThere are \u201csoft\u201d deadlines for projects, online quizzes, and online exams (challenge problems) in the class, but you technically have unlimited attempts and until the end of the semester to get 100% on these assignments because you can request for extensions without penalty. If I was confused on how to do a quiz, I could eventually brute force the quiz until I got 100% because the question bank eventually repeats, or I could come to class to watch him do a few more examples and ask questions.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cexams\u201d were not as intimidating as they sound, and I really value Marsh because of the challenge problems. There are 4 problems to complete after each unit, and the questions still force you to understand the data structure (minus all of the theory and math that might be associated with other 420 professors\u2026). I would allocate 1-2 hours to completing the challenge problems per each unit. The final exam was also a set of 4 challenge problems. These exams were little to no stress since if I messed up, then I could get feedback (except for the final) and re-submit. \r\n\r\nThe projects were moderately difficult, but doable if you give yourself enough time and seek out help if you are dying. I would suggest following the soft deadlines that Marsh provides to stay on track because I felt like he gave an appropriate amount of time for each project. I remember he said as long as you dedicate enough time to this class, you can get an A, and I really do agree with this statement.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-12-23T17:41:24.206880Z"}, {"professor": "Michael Marsh", "course": "CMSC414", "review": "Took this class Spring 2023.
