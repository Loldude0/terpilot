He takes the time to get to know his students, initiates conversations with you, and cracks sardonic jokes. He's very encouraging and accommodating toward his students. Take note, however: once he knows your name and becomes comfortable with you, he will call you out and ask you to answer questions in front of the class. This sometimes involves solving a problem on the front chalkboard. Of course, if you decline, he won't force you, but this is just something he does that might concern some. It's usually the people in front he targets but once in a while he will make his way to the back. The questions are usually easy to answer, though, so don't stress about this. \r\n\r\nProfessor Rowland as a teacher, however, can be challenging, but the content itself isn't. Lectures are usually composed of content material, practice problems, and questions. When covering content, he tends to go off-topic, but when he's taking questions, he often goes through homework and in-class quizzes and gives the answer to you (worth attending for this reason). He provides notes for each topic, and while they can be helpful, they can be equally confusing. If you want organization, it's better to go by the textbook for definitions, relationships, examples, etc. If you ask him a question, his explanations are a hit-or-miss. For explanations, it's better to show up to the discussions and have the TAs explain it to you; I definitely do not recommend skipping the discussions for this class. To get ready for each exam, he provides 2 old exams + answer keys, an online practice exam, and also holds a Zoom review session the night before. The exams are fair and not too hard; grading for partial credit is generous. There is quite a bit of teaching yourself in this class but as long as you put in a decent amount of effort, you should be able to keep an A.

He's probably the sweetest professor I've ever had and is a great guy, but his teaching style is not it. I've never been in a more disorganized class. The lectures aren't really \"learning,\" it's more like someone asks questions and he goes over them for the entire class period. Also, the practice midterms are not like the real exams so be prepared to have a random question thrown your way. I had to do a lot of self-studying for this class and it takes up a lot of work.

He attempts to learn everybody's name and he tries hard to explain the content. He is also very open to questions and walking the class through challenging problems. However, his lectures are somewhat unorganized and honestly a little useless. I went to every lecture, but I hardly paid attention to them because of this. The good news is that this course is super easy, so Dr. Rowland doesn't really need to be that good of a teacher. I mainly used the textbook to write my notes as his notes were kind of all over the place and not very helpful. On the other hand, the discussions were beneficial and were much better at explaining the content than the lectures were, so I would recommend going to discussions over lectures. To prepare for exams, I just completed the practice exams on ELMS and read over my notes. The coursework is hardly time-consuming and I only spent about 2 hours studying per midterm (and 3 hours for the final), with most of that time dedicated to going over the practice exams. Dr. Rowland also usually hosts an online exam review session the night before exams, which I didn't really use, but he basically just answers people's questions and goes over any problems from the practice exams that people wanted help with. The exams themselves are not hard and are pretty similar to the practice exams. As for grading, it's fair, he drops half of your lowest midterm, doesn't use +/-, and is not heavily weighted toward exams. All in all, this is a fairly easy course with plenty of resources and a mediocre, but kind, professor.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-12-16T00:07:54.081766Z"}, {"professor": "Todd Rowland", "course": "MATH135", "review": "Dr. Rowland is very kind and can be funny sometimes.
