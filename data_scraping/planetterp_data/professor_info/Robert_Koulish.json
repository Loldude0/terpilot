This class was the tip of the iceberg, and I have since hit the ground running with reading and thinking about immigration and social philosophy on my own and in my course studies.

The intended professor had to leave after the first week, so Professor Koulish stepped in.  Nevertheless, he did a poor job with this class.\n\r\nHis class is not particularly difficult, yet I wouldn't consider it fair.  For his exams, he provides a powerpoint \"review,\" however none of the topics were on the test.  He gave us a 10-12 page paper near the end of the semester, and a final exam.  The paper was assigned too late in the semester, and he gave very little guidance about what to actually write.\n\r\nMy biggest problems with Koulish came from his lectures.  Not only were his powerpoints messy and hard to follow, but they were also covered with grammar and spelling mistakes.  He rarely seemed prepared.  In addition, his own political beliefs were evident throughout.  He wants you to believe that lawyers who work for the private sector or with the goal of making money are terrible people.  \n\r\nIf you're looking for a LAW class, this is not it.  It is focused primarily on sociology and Koulish's beliefs.  The topics are somewhat related but not cohesive, and the readings are a little random as well.  In addition, he often would not post the reading until the day before it was due. He never responded to a single email I sent him. \n\r\nOverall, he was unorganized and not a good lecturer.  I gave him the benefit of the doubt at first because of the exceptional situation of having to step in at the last minute, but by the end I realized that he is an overall bad professor.
