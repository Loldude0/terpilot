This class was not particularly hard unless you are bad at self-discipline and time management; there is a lot of asynchronous work that you need to complete with deadlines. I really liked the structure of this class because you would have to go to discussions every week and lecture every other. Sometimes the lectures feel long and are hard to follow, coming from someone who has no past knowledge of astronomy. But overall, this class was a very good class for someone who needs to fulfill their natural science general education requirement.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2022-05-17T01:35:20Z"}, {"professor": "Thaddeus Komacek", "course": "ASTR100", "review": "Dr. Komacek was awesome, incredibly accommodating, and tried to make lectures interesting.
