The second one I read it and got an A+. That is to say, you'll get the grade that corresponds to the effort you put in this class. Especially with the fact that there are only 4 graded assignments apart from the discussions, make to study well! Don't think this is an \"easy gen-ed\", but it's an interesting one for sure! \r\n\r\nI will add that the GTA you have really makes the difference. I LOVED the GTA for my section. SHE WAS AMAZING. I never considered myself a history person, but she and Dr. Ross made the course a fun break between my STEM classes. :)", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2024-01-13T18:49:03.236905Z"}, {"professor": "Michael Ross", "course": "HIST134", "review": "Professor Ross was so amazing! He was my favorite teacher this semester since his class always felt like story-time rather than a lecture. He liked to engage the students. The content is so interesting and I am not a history person! Very straightforward midterm and final. My TA (Chloe) was so helpful and was so prompt with responding back to emails. I would 100% take the class over again!", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2024-01-20T01:28:06.872887Z"}], "name": "Michael Ross", "slug": "ross_michael"}
