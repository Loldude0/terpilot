Most people would just be on their laptops or their phones waiting for the quiz at the end of class. The quizzes were on some reading tangentially related to the class, and they would either be really easy or really hard. It would often require you to remember random facts or sentences from the article. \r\n\r\nThe first midterm of this class was a total mess. There was a sample midterm given, but the actual exam was nothing like it. You were allowed to bring a cheat sheet, but that didn't matter. It was essentially random python trivia about random inbuilt python, pandas, numpy, or data-cleaning techniques/commands. If you didn't have it on your cheat sheet, you would not be able to answer the question. These commands had nothing to do with class or the projects. It also included topics that were briefly mentioned in class, not really in the class slides, and that question would be work 20% of the midterm. Almost fully random, the best way to classify this midterm is like a history test, but your textbook is the whole internet. Good luck.\r\n\r\nThe final was better.

His exams were not hard, but some questions were formatted in a way that you may not get any partial credit (which is what happened to me on the final), and in a class where most of your overall grade comes from your exam performances, you need to be a bit aware of any slight curveballs that he could throw at you.

The TA you get will play a big role into if you understand the content more or not, which I think Teli could work on a bit (since his explanations to any questions or his thought process when going through examples in lectures can be a little bit confusing).
