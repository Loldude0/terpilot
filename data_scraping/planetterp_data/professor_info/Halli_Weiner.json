Professor Weiner is great at teaching the subject and she tries really hard to get the students to connect with the material. Although, if you were not interested in animals at all it may have been hard to find the class interesting. Dr.Weiner is always trying to spark a conversation in class, so it is great if you are willing to discuss a lot of material. The best thing about her is she provides specific, distinct feedback on your assignments that really connected with me and helped me succeed in the class.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2022-12-06T02:37:59.917937Z"}, {"professor": "Halli Weiner", "course": "FIRE120", "review": "Although I didn't enjoy the FIRE course, Professor Weiner helped me through the class and certainly contributed to my success.
