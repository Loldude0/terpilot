She's very considerate of your needs as a student, and is very helpful if you're having trouble understanding a concept. Given the way that it's taught (As of the time of this review), HIST204 in particular is an extremely interesting (and easy!) course. You're allowed to skip one of the major quizzes and you are essentially able to pre-write all of the quiz answers in advance and bring them into a test. If you're looking for a fun few credits, try her class.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2022-12-07T18:16:39.181864Z"}, {"professor": "Melinda Baldwin", "course": "HIST204", "review": "Prof Baldwin is probably the most down to earth and professional instructor I\u2019ve had at UMD(although its my first semester). The course is pretty easy but you do have to put a bit of work in for the quizzes to make sure you do well. You can prewrite answers and the lowest out of 4 quizzes is dropped. All the info you need is in lectures meaning you don\u2019t need to do the 40 or so pages of textbook reading per week.
