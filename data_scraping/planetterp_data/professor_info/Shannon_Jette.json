It is only a level 200 class but feels like a graduate class. The quizzes are only doable if you read through every single document she posts and take detailed notes from lecture, if not you're guaranteed a 70% on every quiz. The TA's grade the CHILs like its a graduate paper. Getting an A is close to impossible. They take points off for just about no reason, and always has something to pick at. A minor citation error is not deep enough to lose a whole letter grade on. The final paper is also graded really harsh. I'm convinced they just rush through everyone's paper and assign grades based on how they feel. If there are better options for your gen ed, take those. stay away from this, unless you're a knes major then good luck", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "B-", "created": "2023-10-18T00:59:24.346056Z"}, {"professor": "Shannon Jette", "course": "KNES285", "review": "weekly quiz were hard, the CHIL papers were graded very stricly for no reason. and the final paper is a guaranteed two letter grade drop", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "C+", "created": "2023-10-18T01:00:30.015093Z"}, {"professor": "Shannon Jette", "course": "KNES285", "review": "This class is pretty fair overall. The weekly quizzes are completely based on the lecture slides and assigned readings and are totally fair, anyone that says they're too hard doesn't pay attention in class because I've gotten 8/8 points on almost every single one and it is not that difficult considering you can use your notes during the quiz! There is one quiz each week and a bunch of papers. My TA graded the papers very harshly and was extremely unhelpful in our discussion section and left everyone confused. Dr. Jette herself is very helpful, passionate about the topic, and approachable, but the TA's are the one who grade the written assignments so most of the time I went to him, even though he is not very helpful. It is a bit annoying considering it is a core class and has a good amount of work, but it is manageable.

The lectures although only 50 minutes seem to drag on forever. Attendance is semi-mandatory as she uses point solutions but you drop your lowest two and she doesn't do it every class. Overall weekly most of the time the only assignment is a 25 minute, 8 question, open note quiz so the workload isn't too bad.  However some assignments near the end of the semester are incredibly time consuming. There is no final exam but the final paper is worth 30% of your grade. The good thing is that you kind of build up to it over the semester through four different CHILs but the feedback that you get is practically non existent. The TA's grade very harshly and don't elaborate on why you got off points. Jette wasn't a terrible professor but I would recommend another class if you can help it. Another point to add is that she offered two extra credit opportunities, each allowing for the potential of a one percent grade increase.

There were 4 CHIL assignments which were like essays, but they all helped outline your final paper which made it very simple at the end of the semester. However the CHILs were a big percentage of our grades and unless you write at the graduate level, it is very hard to receive an A on them. We also had weekly 8-point quizzes which were not hard but the questions were also not clear. Very hard to get 100% on them also.

Love Dr. Jette, 5/5 professor!! Great style of teaching, always willing to help bc SHE CARES, gives GREAT FEEDBACK on papers & listens to student criticism- however, overall class experience is 3/5. While the content is interesting & lectures enjoyable... the workload is very time consuming so plan accordingly- stressed me out more than Biomechanics. The weekly quizzes are not hard. It's literally open note so pull up the lecture slides while taking the quiz- answers are in the slides. The only thing that won\u2019t be is the 2 assigned articles you\u2019re given but majority of the time she talks about em in class so if ya pay attention can make an educated guess. Got a 100% on almost all. As far as the CHIL\u2019s they are graded harsh & ur grade depends on who you get as a TA. Won't say names but depending on ur TA all I can do is pray for you\u2026 go on bow ya head. Mine was mostly unhelpful, made me cry/feel stupid, and when asked why something was wrong usually gave an abstract answer that didn\u2019t make sense. Spoken with multiple people who all (which is crazzzy) verbatim said \u201cI feel like no matter what I do it won\u2019t be good enough\u201d- that's a problem. So GO TO DR. JETTE FOR THE CHILS. You have 4 CHILS & use them to build your final paper. Go over the content/main points you want to discuss & make sure you understand WHAT you should be talking about (a lot of people get points off bc they aren\u2019t answering the prompts correctly). Go over that outline with Dr. Jette or your TA (if they\u2019re good), draft your paper, send it to ur TA to receive feedback, edit the paper accordingly, then if you're a religious person\u2026 pray. If you're still unhappy with the grade dispute it & Dr. Jette will grade it herself. If all else fails ur given 2 extra credit opportunities, each for a chance to raise your grade by 1%.
