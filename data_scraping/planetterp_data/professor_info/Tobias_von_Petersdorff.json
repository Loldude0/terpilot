His medical condition is manifested by loud bursts of panting and crying, and overall nervousness. He runs around the front of the classroom, and when he is having trouble reciting a proof will chew on his hand. Because he has panting attacks, students will falsely reassure him that they understand his lecture so he doesn't have an episode, if they think he is about to break down.

That exam and 3 homework assignments are all we have done in this class, so he is completely disinterested in providing feedback to students. When approached about this, he always says they will be ready tomorrow. Finals are soon and we have received feedback on 2 homework assignments from March, nothing else.This is not an appropriate review of student performance. \r\nTo clarify: This teacher has a  condition that negates his ability to be an effective teacher during lecture, and outside of the classroom he finds no reason to provide feedback to students or find other methods to evaluate a student's progress.

Before taking this course, you should probably have a decent understanding of MATLAB, as it is required for the assignments and some of the exam questions have you write MATLAB code.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- Excellent lectures. He always includes every detail and never misses anything that you would need for a homework or exam. Always willing to answer questions in class too.\r\n- Homework was always interesting and fair. You had to do some written work which prepared us for the exams, as well as some MATLAB work which was just a good takeaway from the class. He included some interesting problems with real life applications which was great. He provided hints for tough assignments on the ELMS page and I never felt that the homework was too hard or easy.\r\n- He has some online notes that were extremely helpful. If you missed a lecture, the notes were always published online so you had access to them. Even if you didn't miss lecture, having them as a resource to review was always great.\r\n- He was helpful in office hours. He answered my questions quickly and helped me troubleshoot some issues I had with MATLAB.\r\n- He had a review session before every exam, and wrote a practice exam with solutions before every exam. They were very representative of the real thing, without being a total knockoff. The grading was also very fair. According to elms, midterm 1, midterm 2, and the final had medians of 90, 91, and 86 respectively.

If a lecture seems like it is going to go over time, he sometimes panics. The students in the class try to calm him down by saying that they understand (even if they don't) but I'm not very sure that it's helpful.\r\n- He took a really long time to return grades. The graders for the class took a few weeks to grade the MATLAB assignments. The first two midterms also took a while. We only got our second midterm back on the last day of classes before the final. However, he graded the final in a few days. \r\n- The MATLAB assignments are very long. This isn't much of a con though, if you start early you should be fine.

I think his biggest worry is that students do not understand or cant read his writing, that is usually what causes problems, but to me it just shows how much he cared.

I started doing really well when I went to his office hours, he is alot less nervous and is super kind and understanding when I met with him. I was super nervous going into the final so I met with him and he really calmed my nerves, I think he may have made the final easier on purpose. The only huge negative is that canvas the whole semester did not have the weights in that were talked about on the syllabus, so my grade I thought I had was wrong leading up until finals week...real grade was 6% less than canvas grade. wouldve been nicer to know before so I knew where I actually stood, so I would look out for this.\r\n\r\nMATH121 itself is a weird in-between class, Close but not yet 141.
