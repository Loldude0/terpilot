Like a reviewer below me said -- she will shut you down REAL quick. She can get kind of mean if you question her in the slightest. \r\n2.She has some serious issues regarding body image. She makes some pretty awful jokes regarding skinny girls such as \"oh, well you'll get osteoporosis meanwhile us big boned girls wont.\" It really made me and the rest of the class uncomfortable-- considering most of the class was girls. \r\n3. Unless you're willing to sit through her ranting for 30 min, do NOT ask her about basic research. You've been warned. \n\r\nGrading/Lecture: \r\n1.She does not curve. Her class is out of 1000 points. With two exams and a final. (final is not cumulative.) She also has these \"summary sheets\" that are 30+ easy points. DO THESE.  \r\nHalf of the class points come from lab, which has a MASSIVE amount of information. Learn the diagrams by heart and use the power points given by the TA's during lab. \r\n3. She writes her notes on an overhead projector like in middle school. Her handwriting is AWFUL and she writes unbelievably fast. I would suggest either bringing a laptop or prepare to get wrist cramps. \r\n4. Her exams are fairly ok, if you went to class. They come straight from her notes. so no book necessary here. \r\n5. Her exams consist of multiple choice, T/F, short answer, and a matching that creates a phrase. \r\n5. She has tons of extra credit points! (hence no curve) \n\r\nStudy Tips:\r\nThis class has a lot of material and she will ask you on everything she talked about in class. She hates the book(even though she uses it) and usually has slides that are from the book just to say \"NOPE this is not the right thing. \" So, I would suggest going to class. This class is totally doable and not really that hard if you take the time necessary to look at her notes. She's nothing special, a 3/5. \n", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "A-", "created": "2015-07-06T15:16:00Z"}, {"professor": "Justicia Opoku-Edusei", "course": "BSCI201", "review": "OPOKU IS BAE. Literally this woman is a queen, and her outfits slay the game. On point every single class. Lecture exams aren't bad, just be on top of your stuff. I got A's on all of them. I think my lowest test grade was a 91 on the final. Yeah, so they're not hard, just study and you'll be fine hahah I don't understand how people were getting D's an F's on them when they're really not difficult as long as you prepared yourself. Overall, lecture is pretty good and it's a fun environment. Opoku likes to make jokes and talk about her kids and her life in general, so you always left lecture with a smile even if you were learning about atherosclerotic plaques or synchondroses or some other seemingly boring topic. \n\r\nLab, however, is a different story. I've gotten the general gist that with Opoku, Lecture is okay, and lab is awful, and with Lombardi it's the opposite. This is very true for Opoku, but not as bad as it seems. With lab, you just have to know a LOT more information for the practicals than you do for lecture exams. There are 4 practicals: tissues and cells, skin and bones, muscles, and the nervous system/senses + endocrine system. I got a 94, 83, 86, and 100, respectively. Know. Your. Shit. There is no way else that you'll be able to make it through. Your lab experience will also be defined by your TA. My TA was very sweet and lenient when appropriate. Instead of asking us to identify more challenging muscle origins/insertions like the brachioradialis or tensor fasciae latae, she'd give \"easier\" ones like....deltoid or gluteus maximus, that everyone knows haha. The first practical is a piece of cake. Once it gets to the skeletal/muscular practicals, the volume of information to know SKYROCKETS, but you can do it. Honestly, above all, this is a bio course, and ALL of biology is just memorization. So if you're good at that, this class isn't a problem. Also, don't forget to do the 7 online prelab quizzes. They're online and open note, and probably the easiest 70 points to earn in this 1000-point class. I think I ended up with a 56/70 cus I got 8/10 on a few and I forgot to do one before the deadline. But honestly, don't lose petty points on easy things like prelab quizzes. ALSO, she doesn't curve at the ended since literally 1/5 of every exam/assignment is extra credit. So if you're at a 89.999999% in the end, and your TA isn't nice, expect to get a B+. I had a 92.95% (which is an A-) and thank GOD my TA gave me a straight A, but some aren't so nice. \n\r\nOverall, you can get an A in this class if you put in the work. It's not that big of a commitment for a 4-credit course. And Opoku is the queen of everything, so that makes it 10x more enjoyable. I highly recommend taking this!

The first exam is a wake up call because you realize just how much information you are expected to know for the exam. After that, alter your studying style appropriately and put in enough time and you'll do well! She gives SO much extra credit on tests and in lab, I ended up having over 100% in the class which i never thought was possible. Make sure you study a lot, about a week before the exam at the very least. My studying style was to go through class notes and the lecture slides and make index cards for every topic/term and then go through them a bunch until i knew everything. Making the index cards takes up half of the studying time but trust me its worth it in the end and makes studying so much more effective and easier. Make sure to go to class or you will miss important notes! And study just as much for the lab practical! they have alot of info on them. The third practical nearly killed my brain.

She knows a lot about the material and says everything at least twice in lecture, which helps you remember it. She handwrites notes rather than putting it all on a powerpoint, which is good and bad. It's good because you can see the thought process that goes into something rather than just a solid block of text to look at. It's also good for any diagrams that she needs to show us. However, sometimes it's hard to read her handwriting or if you miss something you can't go look on the slides later. It also sucks when you can't make it to lecture, because she puts most of the important information into the parts that she handwrites.\r\nShe will tell you questions that she always asks on the exams and she does not try to trick you on them.

The info wasn't lined up with the lecture info, so you were basically teaching yourself names and processes and then two weeks later Opoku goes over it in lecture and you finally understand it, after you've already taken the practical.

Whoever gave the 1 star had it absolutely right. I cannot say anything about the 201 experience, but 447 was a nightmare. I took 17 credits the semester I had Dr. Opoku and received high A\u2019s in all of my classes except this one. She purposely picks a TA with no background in the field to grade your exams so they can\u2019t justify why they took off points beyond saying \u201cit\u2019s not on the key.\u201d There were arithmetic errors in my grade calculation on each exam. The entire class had to go to her office hours to argue about each question on the exam, but she was very dismissive about each argument, especially if the whole class had an issue with a question, which contrary to conventional practices. Even if you wrote answers that were verbatim from the slides (which are the only answers she says she will accept), you will get a lot of points off without explanation. The extra 10 points set up on each exam are virtually worthless because it is nearly impossible to finish her exams. The questions are ambiguous in terms of what is being asked and the grading is worse. There is no grading rubric, and points are taken off subjectively and unevenly from test to test. In other words, there is no amount of preparation and readiness that you can demonstrate to do well on the exams. It is completely out of your control. I don\u2019t know where her grading distribution is coming from because most of the class was failing or had low C\u2019s coming into the final. The average on the final was a 75% (153/200). So considering the class average was already in the low C range, and about 50% of the class scored less than a 75%, a great portion of her class obtained failing marks. I had more anxiety about this class than for my MCAT. Even people who had A\u2019s in her class hated the exam grading/teaching style. When exams were compared side-by-side, some people had a lot of points taken off for the exact same answers that received full credit, but appeals for regrades were dismissed with little to no explanation. Her accent is difficult to understand sometimes and her handwriting is atrocious, which becomes an issue when you have to understand big vocabulary words and have no idea what she\u2019s saying or writing. It is also an issue when you have to distinguish hyper/hypofunction and cannot understand which one she said. There is a slight 2-3% curve in the class to account for +/- grades, but it is not 10% like the person was saying below. That 10% is in reference to the extra 10pts on each exam. The material is actually pretty easy, but the grading is frustrating and insufferable. So even if you know the material backwards and forwards and put up correct answers on the exam, you will still get failing grades (60\u2019s) on your tests. Take this class with any other professor than Dr. Opoku. \n\r\nIf you do get stuck into taking this class, she emphasizes hormonal effects on hypertension/hypotension (what caused it, why, what\u2019s the mechanism of action, how do you treat or manage it). She loves GH, cortisol, and insulin. Our final had a few sections (about 20% of the test) on adrenergic receptors in terms of where they act, so BSCI440 was helpful for this class. She hinted at diseases we were going to see again for final, which helps prepare for cumulative review. Make sure you know the distinction between management and treatment. She favored D and E in her multiple choices, so if you don\u2019t know, go with one of those. In general, we had to know symptoms of diseases well because her prompts included minute differences that indicated what the disease was. She used large vocabulary words, both medically pertinent and grammatically, on her exams. Make sure to know both (they will be in her slides) so you understand what will be asked. Sometimes we were asked to define the words, sometimes they were just used and we had to explain how the phenomena occurred. But if you didn\u2019t know what the word meant, you were out of luck, even if the word had nothing to do with biology. We only needed to know signal transduction in detail for the 1st exam. After that (including the final), the most we had to know about it is what type of path it takes, but not the actual process for it. Your best bet is to memorize the slides and regurgitate what they said. Do not deviate from them or you will get the whole question wrong (-10pts) per problem. The final also asked about the same diseases over and over, so don't be concerned if you end up describing the same disease 3 times in 3 different sections on the final. Acromegally, anything cortisol related, and ADH related was heavily emphasized. (She might hint at what she will emphasize for your final in the few weeks approaching it, so be sure to go to class then.)\n", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "B-", "created": "2014-02-20T20:38:00Z"}, {"professor": "Justicia Opoku-Edusei", "course": "BSCI447", "review": "Extremely chilled for a 400-level bio class.

For anyone on the fence between Opoku or Lombardi, either is a good choice but it depends on your learning style. Opoku does not do lecture well at all BUT all the stuff you need to know on the exam is in her powerpoints/from notes you take during class. So if you don't have a problem with self-study, this is a super easy class. TBH all the bad reviews are probably bc their teaching style is more of a lecture type (nothing wrong with that) but with Opoku you need to take time to study and quiz yourself on the material and you will do fine. On my exams I got 89 to 95s and all I did was cram 4-3 days before (I don't recommend doing this) but all i would do is take notes from the powerpoint and use quizlet and thats it lol.\r\nAlthough I didn't have Lombardi I went to her lectures before I had to switch out and she does lecture really well BUT her exams are less memorization and more application (so I've heard) so if that's more of your style then you should probably take Lombardi.\r\n\r\nFor my Opoku gang, I was forced to take her bc of schedule conflicts and i was so upset abt it but I ended up really liking it just bc I find straight memorization easier than application. Literally everything on the exam will be straight from the powerpoints and its straight memorization. STRAIGHT MEMORIZAION. I promise. there's multiple choice, true/false, short answer, and matching (the letters form a sentence).

Just reviewing wont be enough. Its hard. I got 90s on all of mine but I also studied on quizlet throughout the week and tried to connect information together. If you can push yourself to study as much as you can and have some self-control to set aside time to study, you can probably get 80-90s on each practical. Its definitely not impossible.\r\nOverall, its an okay class but if you are not willing to put in the work, you're gonna end up regretting taking the class. Its doable I promise.

On one hand I really enjoyed and appreciated the in depth coverage of the material with a focus on learning and applying concepts rather than memorizing random facts, at the same time, her exams were challenging and expectations were often unclearly communicated. Our class was hybrid with lectures primarily being in the form of pre-recorded lectures which could have contributed to the confusion.\r\n\r\nPROS:\r\n- Lectures cover an extremely in depth presentation of the physiology with plenty of applications and examples to hammer home concepts she wants you to know. I definitely learned the most I have ever learned in a biology class from this class.\r\n- Dr. Opoku's lecture material will prepare you EXTREMELY well for the MCAT if you are planning on taking it.\r\n- Her exams never test you on concepts not discussed in class.\r\n- Dr. Opoku is by far the most knowledgable professor I have had in the biology department. You could probably ask her any question and she would give you a thoughtful thorough answer. She is nice when you talk to her and is always trying to help you succeed (even if her exams don't make it seem that way)\r\n- Dr. Opoku has built in \"extra credit\" on every exam: 20-30 extra points/200 points on average. However, see \"cons\" for why this isn't necessarily why this is always a good thing/helpful.\r\n- Dr. Opoku provides a 40 point extra credit assignment that can help with your grade. Note that it was quite difficult to get full points on this assignment, but extra credit is extra credit.\r\n\r\nCONS:\r\n- Exams are extremely time crunched with almost all questions being short answer. I consider myself an extremely fast test-taker typically taking only half time in other class exams. Dr. Opoku's exams took me near the whole 75 minutes. For reference, her exams were often 8-10 pages long (single sided) with at least 75% of the questions being essay questions. This means the 20 point extra points you can earn are often not \"extra credit\" but rather extra points you can spare to lose.\r\n- Few practice problems were provided directly by Dr. Opoku. If you wanted practice, you would have to use GSS practice questions.\r\n- Exam rubrics are extremely specific. If you didn't write a specific point relevant to the problem, you can lose a large majority of points associated with the problem. There is also no \"follow-through\" credit typically for multi-step physiology problems.\r\n- Your grade is solely composed of 3 midterms, a final, and the extra credit assignment = high stress.\r\n- Opoku's slides are cluttered and often hard to understand without context.\r\n- You have to know a LOT of material and there is no discussion section where you can practice. You are completely left to your own devices and if you don't have a good work ethic, Opoku may not be for you.\r\n\r\nOverall, Dr. Opoku's class is by far the most challenging biology class I have taken, but also the most rewarding. I took away a meaningful understanding of mammalian physiology but sacrificing a lot of time and devotion towards the class as a consequence. I would recommend her class if you want to challenge yourself while learning an immense amount. If this doesn't sound like you, I'd recommend probably steering clear of Opoku at least for BSCI450. Regardless, this is a hard class so whoever you take, you will need to put in the effort!\r\n\r\nTIP: If you do take her class, don't write full sentences. Use arrows to connect concepts. For example instead of writing, \"An increase in A occurs which then causes B to drop which results in C dropping\" say something like \"Up A -> Down B -> Down C.\" It'll save you time and TA's do not take any points off for this.

Most of the test content is directly from the posted slides and reviews sent out a week or so before exams. It's a lot of material, but the exams are fair. On the exams, there will be multiple choice, T/F, and matching. The matching will spell out a phrase. She'll usually give a bonus couple of points on the exams without mentioning it. The final this semester was not cumulative, had a review sheet to study from, and we got 20 bonus points. That being said, there was no curve in the class overall, just on the final. Class was posted videos Mon/Wed and in person on Fri, but all material was on Canvas for reference.\r\nLab: Weekly readings and pre-lab quizzes and maybe 3 or so in-class assignments. The practicals were decently easy as long as you start studying in advance. I'd recommend the posted review quizzes and anki (google it) to study. \r\nOverall a manageable class.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "A-", "created": "2023-12-26T15:22:14.477274Z"}, {"professor": "Justicia Opoku-Edusei", "course": "BSCI342", "review": "This class didn't have any reviews at all, so I kinda went into this class blind and took it during the winter break to raise my science GPA. I previously had opoku for anatomy and enjoyed it, so I found it interesting she taught this course also. Once again, I could say she did not disappoint. This class was not exactly as easy as I hoped, but it was very doable. It's a quick 3-week asynchronous course, so she pretty much just posts all the slides/recordings with the expectation that you are responsible for taking notes for the exams. The only assignments in the class involved 3 exams (2 midterms and 1 cumulative final -- all multiple choice), but she usually adds a lot of extra points to your existing scores on each exam, which I think is a way for her to curve them based on the class's performance. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the exam structures themselves, where I feel like the choices are designed to make you second-guess yourself. However, as long as you take notes on all the slides you should be okay. I think she curved our final grades as well, since I didn't actually expect to get an A- in this class. Anyways, Opuku is a great professor, so if you want a science class to take during the winter I'd recommend this one :)", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "A-", "created": "2024-01-25T14:54:09.863781Z"}], "name": "Justicia Opoku-Edusei", "slug": "opoku-edusei"}
