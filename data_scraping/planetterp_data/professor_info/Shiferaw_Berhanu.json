Every Wednesday he would teach content and then immediately make you put away all of you notes and do a worksheet on content you had barely learned, unaided. He couldn't figure out how to put grades on canvas, so the Canvas grade only reflected your WebAssign scores, meaning you wouldn't know how much the \"worksheets\" (which were basically pop quizzes) and exams (that most people didn't pass but still weren't curved) affected your grade until midterm grades were released and you have 2 days to see if you need to withdraw from the course. I strongly recommend to not take the honors version of this course because if you have an unhelpful professor like I did then you have no TA to help where you are struggling. He seems like a nice man who really enjoys math but he was not a good teacher", "rating": 2, "expected_grade": "W", "created": "2022-12-05T18:26:00.279252Z"}, {"professor": "Shiferaw Berhanu", "course": "MATH140H", "review": "Professor Berhanu (Shif) was awesome for Calc I. As far as basic course details go, he doesn't give too much work, the midterms were pretty easy, and there were very few times that we faced a problem that we were getting graded for and not have seen it/practiced for it before. Beyond that, He's very good at breaking down and explaining concepts and is clearly excited to be teaching. I don't think it would be that crazy to call his level of excitement \"cute\". He does have a non-american accent for speaking English, but once you hear him talk long enough you get used to it.

This means working harder than you think you should. The only way you can pass is to study every single day, and practice problems everyday. I mean it - do not ever skip studying. He does not give partial credit. He is not a generous grader. So if you write a solution that is technically correct but somehow missing a minor point or two, he will give you a zero. He will accept only a perfect solution. He has a hard time connecting with students. He does not care about anything you tell him. He will only care about your perfect solutions on a test. If you are a genius and you enjoy a challenge, this is the right professor for you. He is very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the topics in this class. But if you are not a genius and have to work hard for it, turn away. You will have a hard time in this class because he has no problem in giving out zeros.

If two students try to answer a question in class, one of them being a favorite, he will pretty much disregard the answer of the other student, even if it is correct. He goes unnecessarily fast in class and covers the board while he is writing, with no intention to pause and explain what he has written while he was covering it. So you are always playing catchup in his class if you sit in a seat with a poor angle to the board. If you ask a question about a problem that was already done previously, he will not answer it and tell you to look back at your notes (but sometimes the whole point of the question is to clear up the misunderstandings you have about the problem which has been scribbled into your notes to keep up with the pace of the lecture). It almost seems like he wants you to struggle a bit in terms of following along with the lecture.
