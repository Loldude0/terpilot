I honestly think he belongs teaching at an elementary school. Very unprofessional. Shows up to class 10 minutes late, and he has to rush through his lectures because he's so late. Speaking of which, his lectures notes are pretty bad. And a lot of the time when we are doing example problems in the packet, he skips a lot of them because \"we should know how to do them.\" Hands down, the laziest and most apathetic math teacher I have ever come across. One day the projector wasn't working, and he legit spent the whole class trying to fix it instead of writing things on the board. It doesn't end there, if you dare ask him a question he will give you an attitude 4/5 times. Hey Tim, you are a teacher how about you freaking teach us??? He also refuses to answer any questions during DISCUSSION. The whole point of discussion is to get help and understand how to do problems but noooooooo We have to \"discuss among each other.\" How am I going to ask anyone else for help when the whole freaking class doesn't know whats going on! Oh yea, he also shows up late to his office hours! Good luck trying to get help from him... \n\r\nNow here is where things will take a turn for the worst. HIS TESTS. In 50 minutes, we take a test that's 8 QUESTIONS long, all of which are extremely hard. All the other sections have the same amount of time, but only 4-5 questions per test. Talk about an unfair douche. He also does this thing where he counts down to zero at the end of the test. If you dare turn in that test a millisecond after he says \"zero\" he will penalize you. \n\r\nSome final notes, He is really apathetic about his job, very lazy and could not give a damn about his students. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT SIGNING UP FOR PILACHOWSKI, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. The only people that actually do good in his class are the geniuses that would get an A in the class no matter what teacher they had.  Seriously look for a better teacher.

The Calculus in the class was fairly simple as this isn't a Calculus class, you're simply using it to calculate certain values (Covariance, mean, etc.) Professor Pilachowski went through his PowerPoint slides each class and posted supplementary material on the course website. I thought he did an excellent job at explaining the material, and the students that didn't do well were simply not interested in putting the time. I had to relearn parts of Calculus and still managed to get an A (without minus) in his class.  The most annoying part of the class was his midterms. He often didn't print enough exams or answer sheets. He also doesn't give us enough time to complete the exam. I felt incredibly pressured to finish the exam on time, and rarely did anyone leave the class before the time was up. His TA Yiran Li was exceptional. I attended every discussion and never skipped, and working through sample problems was a tremendous help. For his midterms, he will post previous exams, and if you are lucky enough, your exam might look like one of them, but don't bank on it. I recommend doing the previous exams without looking at the answers, working through homework problems, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, look over material that was taught in class and not covered in the homework (Method of Moments, Maximum Likelihood, Probability Approximations). If you don't understand something, YouTube is a great help. Yes the below is true, he comes late, he doesn't notice the clock, and can be boring at times, but he is a phenomenal and lenient teacher, and if you TAKE NOTES and study hard, you can pass with an A. I didn't visit the tutors at all for this class either, so don't stress it, just do your part. I don't consider myself mathematically gifted, I just work hard enough to earn the A, and it is doable for this class. He also allows you to bring a calculator and a sheet of notes to the midterms, and the combined sheets of notes to the final. The final was far more relaxing because I was able to revise my answers multiple times and get a good grade.

He expected lecture outlines to be printed for every class (I didn't do it because I didn't want to use so much paper and ink). He moved extremely fast and only used a slideshow. The lessons seemed to be directed only at those who already had experience, and he responded rudely to anyone who asked questions. He was late to class multiple times and gave excuses like \"being in his office and not looking at the clock.\" He was even late to the final! In addition, I had to make up and exam during his office hours and had to do so in the office, making it difficult to concentrate because he loudly (and rudely) explained and assisted other students coming in the entire time.

He is  the most rude and bitter man I have ever encountered. DURING our \u201creview\u201d he wouldn\u2019t even turn the light off when a student nicely asked him too because nobody could actually SEE HIS notes for the exam. I put \u201creview\u201d in quotations because his idea of a review is not at all helpful in preparing for the exam. He refuses to give you the answers to the worksheet he hands out. You\u2019ll spend the whole class trying to figure out the answers and he will not answer any questions. \r\nHe teaches calc on a PowerPoint which has proven to be the LEAST EFFECTIVE way to do this. Don\u2019t bother trying to write anything down because you won\u2019t have time & if you do you won\u2019t be able to pay attention to how you actually do it. Although he does a terrible job of explaining the information anyway. \r\nIf you have the great misfortune of having him as your teacher you will have to listen to him go over stupid class rules nearly every class. ONE time he even spent 20 minutes in the beginning of class going over \u201cbike safety\u201d. Nobody else in the class understood why he was doing this or what was going on. However I knew exactly what happened because the day before I saw him screaming at some kid riding his bike because he almost got hit by him. So basically he wasted all of our time because of his own personal issues. He is the worst. \r\nThe TA\u2019S even admit he makes exams 10x harder then necessary. My TA told my class that for teachers like Tim who make the exams harder than the worksheets and homework he gives you, you should research online other schools and their coursework to try and learn the information. Because it\u2019s my job to teach myself right?! \r\nIf you take this class this will 100% be the case. Guaranteed you\u2019ll be teaching yourself all of the information. If you have absolutely no background in calc then you are extremely screwed for his class. \r\nThere are also no curves in his class even though so many people argue how unfair his tests are. ALSO, his advice to go look at passed exams will not help you in the slightest. He claims that they are similar to the exams, but they\u2019re not at all. \r\nI learned more WHEN THE TA sub\u2019d for him for a day and actually wrote and explained the information on the board, then during the whole semester with him teaching. \r\nAnother thing is that you\u2019ll have lecture quizzes all the time in this class. He says they\u2019re only once a week but a lot of times they\u2019re twice a week. If you leave lecture even 10 min early there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll miss one because sometimes he\u2019ll give them in the last 5 min of class!! \r\nThere is also SO MUCH HW.. at least 5 assignments with 10-15 problems each w likelihood of having a-e parts as well due every week. \r\nIt is clear that he doesn\u2019t understand the concept of actually teaching. I highly recommend you look elsewhere for teachers because unless you are amazing at calc you will spend the the full semester trying to learn on your own.\r\n 1 star is an overstatement for this man, he deserves 0. \r\n", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "B-", "created": "2019-04-10T03:53:23Z"}, {"professor": "Timothy Pilachowski", "course": "MATH141", "review": "Pilachowski is an OK teacher.

For people who have never taken calculus and this is the first course you will be taking, you want to AVOID PILACHOWSKI at all costs. His teaching method is quite possibly the worst fit for a math class. The way he teaches is by clicking \"Next\" on a 10-year-old PowerPoint. In lectures, he does not really explain anything or take any questions or do a real practice problem or show the steps or any of that. He does none of that at all. The way you learn math from a good teacher is by them showing you an example and giving you a step-by-step process on how to solve that specific problem in the future so that you would know what to do with that specific type of problem. Rather, he just reads word for word the complicated boring textbook definitions of terms in his powerpoints that never make sense to anybody. So to the general masses, unless reading word for word textbook definitions is how you learn math, his lectures are utterly useless. Now it would be unfair of me to critique the grading because all 140 classes have discussion worksheets and web assigns due each week graded on accuracy so even though that's a bit harsh, it is not his fault that's the way the coursework is given at UMD. What I can say however is that HE DOES NOT CURVE any of the tests even if the majority of the class fails or gets low grades. The most he does is drop a couple of the lowest discussion worksheets and hw assignments at the end of the semester which will not even impact your grade (1-2%maybe at most). What I can say is that when he is not clicking away at his PowerPoint, he constantly tries to make jokes throughout the lecture, as if to make up for the teaching method. He does organize things well and gives deadlines on the syllabus which I give him credit for. In order to succeed in this class, you would have either needed to A) have taken some form of calculus already so you have a thorough understanding already regardless or B) Have an amazing TA, prioritize all of your time onto this class and make the most out of every discussion session along with self-teaching yourself the entirety of the course.

He is for sure not the best that you can get although I won't say he is absolutely terrible\u2014 he gets the job done. I took AP Calculus AB in high school which resulted in me getting significantly above the average on all the midterms and on the final exam but I can definitely say that if you have never taken a Calculus course before, you will have trouble in this class.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- The final exam is EXACTLY the same as the previous couple years' final exams. Like pretty much identical but different nambers. If you practice about 5 of them from the UMD math test bank, you should have no problem at all on the final. In my opinion (and reflected by the scores), the final exam is the easiest exam of the all the exams you will take in this class by far. This is important because the final is worth nearly 30% of your grade in this class.\r\n- Midterms are pretty easy and fair. There is always a topic or two for each unit that was never covered in AP Calculus though (ex: Newton-Raphson Method, and Delta Epsilon Proofs\u2014 in my experience at least), so you definitely need to study for this class, even if you've taken AP.\r\n- TAs for this class are generally helpful, even if they aren't necessarily yours. \r\n- With some classes, you can get away with not going to discussion, but not this class. During every discussion there is a worksheet that you do with your table that counts for a grade.\r\n- Homeworks are on WebAssign and they are pretty easy and are good practice.\r\n- There is a lecture outline for every lecture and makes it pretty easy and straight-forward to follow through.\r\n- Pilachowski ends up dropping your lowest couple homeworks and discussion worksheets to help your grade. He also cuts your lowest midterm exam score in half so it is worth fewer points in the final calculation. For example: if your lowest midterm is a 70/100, it will be changed to a 35/50 which helps your grade by about 1 or 2%, which is helpful if you are close to the next letter grade.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- My worst complaint about this professor: he spends SO MUCH TIME at the beginning of EVERY CLASS talking about absolute nonsense. Pilachowski is infamous for hating bikes and electric scooters and will come into class with a new anecdote about how he almost runs over someone EVERY. SINGLE. CLASS... He also has general messages that he repeats every. single. class. which were helpful for maybe the first few weeks but even during the last weeks of the semester, he was reminding us to \"mAke SuRe YoU PuT mAtH140 In ThE sUbJeCt LiNE of EaCh EmAiL oR eLSe I wILL nOT rEaD iT\" or \"mY CLocK iS SeT tO ThE tImE iN cOLorAdO\". Not to mention that at the beginning of every class, he states \"I think I will get through chapter ___ today\", but then he doesn't and tells us to read the textbook or watch the lecture video online... Maybe if he didn't talk about the most irrelevant nonsense during the beginning of lectures, then he would actually finish teaching.\r\n- Like every college course, exams are everything. In this class specifically, you will take one diagnostic test at the beginning of the year, 4 midterms, and one final which total to over 80% of your overall grade. Each midterm is 12.5% of your final grade. Study hard for these exams as they will make or break your grade. One bad exam can drop you letter grades.\r\n\r\nOverall, pick someone else please.

Pilachowski makes succeeding in the course a lot harder than needed be. He is the laziest professor I have ever had. His lectures consist of at least 20 minutes of rambling before getting to any actual math, and even then, he'll still interrupt his own teaching and give you some anecdotal story that has absolutely no reason to be brought up and just wastes time. When the lecture is 50 minutes long, you shouldn't be wasting at least 20 minutes talking about past students or your disdain for scooters on campus, please teach. That's another thing, his teaching or the lack thereof. Pilachowski relies heavily on slides posted in the canvas classroom to \"teach\". They are very brief, with a few examples he works through in class. Occasionally he'll spend a slightly longer amount of time doing one to stress something, but usually he'll just blast through them as fast as he can and explains nothing. He wouldn't have to rush if he just shut up at the beginning of classes...He has his lectures from Covid times posted in the Canvas classroom so there is basically no point going in person, and those you can skip through his ramblings in. Still, they're the same as his in-person lectures, so there is very little difference between the two. He doesn't do any grading, thats all up to your TA, mine was kinda the only reason I wasn't failing throughout the semester. I'll admit, my grade was not entirely due to Pilachowski's horrible teaching style, I underestimated the amount of effort  needed for exams in this course. His exams are basically the same as the practice exams provided in the test bank, just study for them more than I did. His review sessions are pointless, unless you have bad TAs who don't do something outside of class (i.e. they don't have review sessions of their own). Once again, he wastes time sitting there talking, saying the same things he says before every class for at least 10 minutes, and then tells you to do it all yourself basically. With the remaining 5 minutes of time, he'll then give you useless comments on each question, displayed in the tiniest font possible, making it impossible to read or understand what he's explaining if you don't have his review sheet directly in front of you.Teach yourself the material and get help outside of the classroom if you need it, cause Pilachowski sure won't make this class easy. P.S. there are no answer keys for the numerous practice finals anywhere, so good luck with studying for that.", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "C", "created": "2023-12-09T04:54:06.088330Z"}, {"professor": "Timothy Pilachowski", "course": "MATH140", "review": "IF YOU TOOK CALC BEFORE, you should be okay.

You're exams are going to cover more content, and be significantly harder than other math 120 sections.
