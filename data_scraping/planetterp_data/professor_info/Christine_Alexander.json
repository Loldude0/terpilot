I will be honest and say that this class is good in terms of its grading scheme in which it is completion, but it gives next to no wiggle room or understanding for extenuating circumstances apart from for attendance. \r\n\r\nIf you are taking this class for any reason other than it being required for you, I strongly urge you not to, or at least to not take Christine. it is somewhat amusing to look at while not remembering that you are also graded for engagement, at which point you realize that you are paying hundreds to thousands of dollars this semester to be forced to make bird calls or dance during an engineering course. \r\n\r\nYou have several assignments required every week, required attendance, required reading/listening/watching every week amounting to hours outside of the class and no time in class to complete any of it. so for this reason, if you have a lot on your plate this semester maybe don't take it. \r\n\r\nenough with the cons, here's the pro's of taking the class / Christine:\r\n- easy to get an A if you dedicate a lot of time to the course and don't forget anything. \r\n- it's essentially a sociology class so if that's your thing just know if you don't get into any sociology classes, you can settle for this one. \r\n- you don't have to take any notes, there's no exams. just remember generally what was discussed in each class.", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "A-", "created": "2023-10-23T03:50:11.539582Z"}, {"professor": "Christine Alexander", "course": "ENES200", "review": "Christine is a great professor as she is super nice and helpful. However, the class itself is hit or miss. \r\n\r\nLet me start with the pros:\r\nThe contract grading system is really nice. It is basically completion grades for hard work and reasonable answers, so it\u2019s an easy A.\r\nThe TAs are really nice and chill\r\nThis class satisfies both humanities and I-series for Gen Ed credit\r\n\r\nCons:\r\nThere is way too much homework. Every week, there is at least 3+ hours of homework (2 pre-lecture assignments and a weekend assignment). While homework is obviously important, some of the assignments feel unnecessary or can be much shorter. This is a Gen Ed class and shouldn\u2019t have as much work as major requirements. \r\nThere is a lot of busy work. The week reflection assignments don\u2019t need to be 500 words and the final reflection seemed unnecessary given that we already had the final ethical analysis paper due that same week.\r\n\r\nIn short, this class is not for everyone. Some people will enjoy the class and all the activities while others won\u2019t. Though if you need to satisfy Gen Ed requirements, this class is a fine choice. It\u2019s an easy A but just beware of the workload.", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "", "created": "2023-12-15T22:40:52.299586Z"}, {"professor": "Christine Alexander", "course": "ENES200", "review": "The Class Is Easy, and Christine is a nice person. But her class is pretty terrible. \r\n\r\nPros: There are virtually no grades. Put some mild effort into the (very simple) assignments and paper and as long as it's coherent you'll be fine. The TAs are usually on your side and will help you with whatever you need. \r\n\r\nCons: Pretty much everything already said. This class felt like elementary school. We did \"fun\" activities such as \"pretend to talk to inanimate objects around the room at different distances\", \"walk around the room impersonating words\", and \"diagram a person flipping a light switch.\" Required attendance (bc why else would anyone attend). My biggest gripe is that some of the info seemed very biased based on her views on politics, society, etc. \r\n\r\nOverall: easy gen ed just show up and write what she'd want to hear and you'll be fine but otherwise this is a waste of your tuition and brain cells", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-12-21T18:53:24.205421Z"}, {"professor": "Christine Alexander", "course": "ENES200", "review": "it was an easy A. but the class is annoying", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-12-22T23:28:32.713533Z"}, {"professor": "Christine Alexander", "course": "ENEE200", "review": "Christine is very sweet and accommodating!

She does seem to really to care about her students as she even goes as far as trying to learn everyone's names (there's like 50 people in the class too).  If you need more time or help on an assignment, she will bend over backwards to help. I don't know why so many people are giving her shit for the class content. It's the curriculum that she is forced to teach. Some of the overall content is actually pretty interesting too. For example, the class goes over some interesting case studies of engineering gone wrong, such as the challenger explosion or Boeing 737 max disaster. Some of in class activities and assignments are kind of silly though, and there are a lot of them. However, everything is literally just a completion grade and all you have to is show up and participate. Just go into the class with an open mind and try to have fun with it.
