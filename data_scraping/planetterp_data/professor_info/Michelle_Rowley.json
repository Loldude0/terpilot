She\u2019s not understanding because even though i joined the class a week late, she was not helpful in getting me on track and rather took off points and told me i was wrong. I didn\u2019t have my camera on for one small portion of the class and me and someone else in a breakout room were muted when she came in and she made a rude comment about us not talking.

Assignments would have expectations added on after turning them in and a weekly assignment went from 1-2 pages to ~7. Due EVERY SUNDAY. In addition to that assignment every week for class we were expected to read 30+ pages of readings as well as 1-2 films. This isn't to say that I didn't like Professor Rowley as a person, she always tried to be reasonable and accommodating, but her style of running this class just isn't it. As for finals we were expected to do a class facilitation in addition to a 10 page 1.5 space font research paper which was really overwhelming.
