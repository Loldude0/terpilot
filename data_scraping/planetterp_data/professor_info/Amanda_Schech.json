She answers all questions students ask, even if it is cutting into time she needs to teach more information. She provides practice exams and exam tips, and sends out an email about two days before the exams saying the broad topic each question will be with how many points. All questions on exams are clearly related to what we learned in class, so just make sure you are listening and study before exams (I personally do all of the textbook problems she recommends from the syllabus for the topics that will be on the exam). She grades SUPER quickly, like in three days for regular exams, and literally just one day for the final. The curving is fair.

Lab reports take a while and have a ton of calculations, but she grades fairly and the exams are also pretty fair if you just understand the study guides and optional pre-lab walk throughs for each lab report. She also showed her face a couple times during our actual lab portions to check up on if the labs are going well which is pretty rare from a lab coordinator TBH.
