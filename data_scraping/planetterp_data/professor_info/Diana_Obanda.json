There was no safety lab and no safety rules which resulted in me almost losing my eyesight in lab. Clear lack of communication with the professor and her TAs, as both would give different procedures and different information. The worst of it all was one lab called for us to combine to things that makes a corrosive and hazardous gas, which got in my eyes. Took 20 minutes for anyone to be concerned and there was only concern because my lab partner had looked up the reaction and hazardous products.
