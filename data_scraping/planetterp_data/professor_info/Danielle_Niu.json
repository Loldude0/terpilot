FIRE 120 itself can be dull at times; reading scholarly papers on topics that you aren't passionate enough about to read a scholarly paper on can suck, but the assignments are pretty easy and don't take an enormous amount of time if you stay focused. That being said, I'm moving forward into FIRE 198 with project Greenhouse, which will hopefully be more engaging than 120, and I'm very happy that Dr. Niu is the one in charge of the project.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-11-29T21:33:51.859916Z"}], "name": "Danielle Niu", "slug": "niu_danielle"}
