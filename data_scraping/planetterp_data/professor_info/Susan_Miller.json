The class was extremely easy, and I had a lot of fun. Not only did we learn about the different styles, but we also got into the studio to learn how to perform these dances. There were journals almost once a week, but they were not hard, about one page each. The midterm was a group project, and the final was a project. The class is laid back.

Each time I walked into class she'd greet me with a smile and genuine excitement. She cares for her students like they're her children and ensures that everyone has their needs met. She constantly asked how we were doing, if we needed help with anything, etc. Her heart is made of pure gold. Assignments consist of writing assignments (super straightforward), no quizzes, and no tests. The \"mid-term\" is a paper or choreographed dance, and the final is a paper or presentation. Love her so so much!!", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-12-06T20:45:26.617995Z"}], "name": "Susan Miller", "slug": "miller_susan"}
