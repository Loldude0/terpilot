Dr. Lewis does a great job with this class! It is heavily discussion based - there are readings before every class, and then either students or Dr. Lewis will give a presentation and lead a discussion on the material. We wrote summaries for about a third of the readings along with a final paper analyzing feminist theory behind a current tweet/meme. Strongly recommend this class for anyone looking to learn more about feminism and women's issues across a broad range of topics.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2019-05-25T00:55:27Z"}, {"professor": "Sydney Lewis", "course": "WMST298D", "review": "Unfair grading.
