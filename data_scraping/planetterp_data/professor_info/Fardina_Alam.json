She is often 5-10min late (and will hold us late), talks through exams, and homework is vague/subjective and is graded harshly. Our first exam had a very confusing format. Short answer questions switched from the answers being a/b/c/d to I/II/III/IV halfway through. Questions looked like short answer until you turned to the next page-- surprise! It's multiple choice. The exam was also 10 pages long for a 50min class. She also seems to have a bit of an attitude by default-- told us mid exam that if we miss an exam, we need to tell her ahead of time, otherwise we'd lose points... this was DURING the exam, when everyone was rushing to finish, because the exam was so long. She also often glosses over student concerns when they are brought up in class.

She is hard to understand because of her accent and her English grammar is not great, making hw questions hard to understand.
