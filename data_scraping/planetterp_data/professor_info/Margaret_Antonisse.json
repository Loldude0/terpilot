A slight drop in your score and your grade will go whoosh and it is VERY DIFFICULT to raise it again. A+ cutoff was 99%, even though the GPA is the same for an A as an A+, I just found it strange.\r\n2- This class is not an easy elective, especially if you have no prior knowledge of linguistics: DON'T take the course unless if you're really passionate about it and be prepared for it to be very abstract.\r\n3- Her demeanor with students: this fluctuates. When it comes to something besides questions about the course or material, she is nice and understanding. But to me, and for many of my classmates, her reaction when you ask a question can sometimes feel degrading and make you feel stupid.\r\n\r\nThis is my own experience, just my raw opinion without sugarcoating.

She's been doing this for a while and knows her stuff. Takes everything really slow, class was extremely easy for me and homework served as a nice chill break from other heavy coursework. Exams were super fair, discussions were good, content was interesting and well-paced. Workloads weren't bad, one assignment per week that takes about an hour. Uses clickers in class but most of the time, you get full credit for clicker questions regardless of what you pick; it's just for participation. She was very responsive and helpful for any confusion, encouraged participation in class, had a good personality and pedagogy. I would take her again. She admittedly does have a little trouble handling wrong answers in class, like a lot of \"welllllll not exactly\" and I see how that could come off as demeaning but I personally didn't take it that way. The TAs were grad students in Linguistics and were really helpful. \r\nNow, I will say that this class is not really a \"history\" class and is somewhere between a humanities class and a math class. Most of the semester is spent on the technical side of linguistics, looking at how sounds and words and sentences are internally structured and forming these systematic rules for language. For me, being used to this type of thinking in CS, it was fine. But I can see how it would be hard for some people who may not be as used to such technical coursework.\r\nI will also say that this class probably is a little too much for a GenEd and there are easier GenEds for DSHS.
