You would really enjoy having them as a professor or TA. They always work around your schedule to make sure that you can always meet the deadlines or make sure you're understanding the content happening in the class. Overall they work with you more than anything, making sure that you don't feel overwhelmed with work sometimes. There can be a lot of busywork at times though, so don't take this class if you are trying to skirt by without doing anything... so big no no. You can easily fail this class lol. But talk with them and get to know them, you'll find them quite enjoyable and fun!", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-12-22T01:44:35.617181Z"}], "name": "Ava Serra", "slug": "serra_ava"}
