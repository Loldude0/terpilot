The man spends hours preparing for his lectures and it really pays off. He is approachable, gives constructive feedback, and creates a welcoming environment. He openly welcomes student feedback, and he really knows his stuff. He is an engineer, so he tends focus a lot on the science-heavy parts of the course. Since I'm a STEM major, I appreciated that, but I know some of my liberal arts classmates found the science stuff difficult to understand. That said, you could understand literally zero about the science stuff and still get a perfect grade in this course. All of the projects were great too, except for the one group project which wasn't even his own design. Loved this class and really appreciated Dr. Frezzo.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2022-05-06T00:55:08Z"}, {"professor": "Dennis Frezzo", "course": "INST154", "review": "Excellent guy and a great professor. I always found his lectures super informative and entertaining. Not only does he know the history of Apollo well, but he also combined it with his own personal experiences as an engineer to give more context to some of the engineering challenges. This was a STEM-heavy class, so a lot of the work and lectures naturally gravitated towards STEM topics. Despite this, I think he did a great job trying to diversify the lectures to focus on the non-STEM aspects of the Apollo program too. He also values student feedback and participation, and he encourages his students to participate in discussions if they have questions or comments. Furthermore, he is very accommodating and approachable, which really helped me when I got sick during the semester. I 110% recommend this class and Dr. Frezzo!\r\n\r\n", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2022-05-17T15:11:45Z"}, {"professor": "Dennis Frezzo", "course": "INST346", "review": "Frezzo is passionate and knowledgeable. He's a nice guy. But unfortunately the class is poorly organized and the lectures can be confusing to follow since he sometimes goes on tangents. There aren't slides or anything either so it can be really hard to figure out what's going on, especially since this is the first exposure to this topic for many. I would not recommend taking 346 with him just because of the poor organization alone.", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "", "created": "2022-09-22T18:17:45.054419Z"}, {"professor": "Dennis Frezzo", "course": "INST346", "review": "He's a chill guy but there seems to be barely any structure to his lectures.

There was little work outside of class, just a quiz that had to be completed before each one. There were graded discussions during class but I didn't mind showing up because his lectures were thought out and interesting. Every few weeks we would have a decently large project due which required a good bit of work outside of class but besides these the class was easy. The final paper was definitely the hardest assignment (obviously) and has a large workload but, he provides ample resources and time for you to complete it. I didn't use these resources and procrastinated so the final was pretty hard for me but that was my fault, not his. Overall, this class is really interesting and Frezzo is a teacher who cares about the subject as well as his students.
