He taught me so much in one semester and made it seem as though the grade really wasn't important. If a teacher can make students care more about learning than what they got in the class, then that's just amazing. I highly recommend this class!

In discussions, all we did was talk and analyze the texts, that's it. There were occasional discussion boards. Throughout the course, there were 2 larger projects - I think. Those required some research, but it was fairly easy. There's no exams or quizzes, but the final was HARD. Closed notes and it's material from the entire semester.
