The class itself is super practical, so there was little lecturing, and more of the instructor just giving you a project rubric and resources before throwing you into the deep end. This is far from a bad thing though! I truly learned a lot in this class, and it was so nice having a practically aimed course in theatre. The instructor also provided plenty of resources and was always willing to help and work around your schedule.\r\nI highly recommend taking courses with Dr. Van Tran Nguyen!", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2022-08-04T06:20:58Z"}], "name": "Van Tran Nguyen", "slug": "nguyen_van_tran"}
