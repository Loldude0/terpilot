He truly wants his students to succeed and so he lets everyone resubmit their HWs as many times as they need to do well. He'll also work one-on-one with anyone having trouble and will make sure that everyone understands the content. He's super smart and also so clearly passionate about what he does which makes the class that much more interesting, and it makes me excited to learn more. Although his teaching style isn't for everyone, (very discussion based and doesn't follow the slides he prepares, instead goes in direction of questions asked during class) I personally have benefitted a lot from the lengthy discussions. Definitely take this class!!!", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-04-10T03:42:08.891549Z"}], "name": "Jared Wilmoth", "slug": "wilmoth"}
