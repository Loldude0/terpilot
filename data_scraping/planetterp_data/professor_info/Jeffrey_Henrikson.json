His video lectures are clear and concise, giving you the \u2018need to know\u2019 minus the fluff. While a textbook is required, the exams are 90% according to the videos so watching Jeff\u2019s lecture videos will suffice if you want an A. The topics are engaging and require little to no math, making this course perfectly suited for a non-science major looking to take a science course/lab and earn a high grade. Granted, it takes a considerable amount of work to earn a high grade, but it\u2019s not because Jeff is a harsh grader - he\u2019s fair and considerate - but rather, the course is condensed into 3 weeks so there\u2019s much to cover and learn. However, whenever you need help, Jeff is there and holds Zoom office hours 4x a week. Overall, this is a must take if you are reading reviews of science courses and wondering: \u2018which is going to make me the least stressed, the most interested, and the most invested?\u2019 This is the one.
