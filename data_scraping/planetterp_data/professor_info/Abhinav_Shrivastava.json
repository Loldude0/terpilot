I feel like the class's pacing could be better, as the beginning of the class is extremely slow, but the last few weeks are a bit rough with assignments, final project checkpoints, and the final exam all overlapping. The lectures can be dry and math theory heavy but if you're interested it's doable. And all the lectures are recorded and taught on zoom concurrently so you don't have to physically attend class.\r\n\r\nProfessor Shrivastava is very kind and understanding when it comes to grade concerns or other logistical concerns. Almost no one fails this class. That being said, the TAs (for my class at least) were very hard on grading and rarely granted regrade requests. But like I said, it doesn't really matter unless you're trying to get a 95 or more because the curve is high.\r\n\r\nOverall, I recommend this class for those who are interested in machine learning/deep learning. If you're not interested in the topics you *will* be bored out of your mind.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "B+", "created": "2023-05-01T14:23:31.464219Z"}, {"professor": "Abhinav Shrivastava", "course": "CMSC472", "review": "Really nice professor. Gives 7 late days to use for homework assignments throughout the semester, lets us use cheat sheets for midterm and final. Throughout the course, in each lecture he'll mention if a question or topic specifically will be on the final or midterm, so if you note them down throughout the semester you basically have half of the midterm/final questions right there. Knows a ton of stuff about deep learning since he's been a bit of a helping hand/pioneer in the field itself as well. Nice curve at the end of class. Because there's a group final project though, you probably want to take the class with a friend since you can choose groups.
