It was her first semester teaching, but she did her best to give us as much information and resources as possible. She was super flexible with deadlines as long as we got our assignments in by the time we said we would and her smaller assignments were helpful to prepare for the big ones.\r\nDefinitely ask her for help if you need it, she gave me a lot of comments while I was working on my papers and it was super helpful.
