The lectures aren't the most fun but he tries his best to be engaging. Most content can be self taught from the online textbook and assignments. Lectures are posted online weekly, so it's not necessary to go to the class. Two midterms and a final, all a combination of MC and open ended questions. The class definitely requires work to understand concepts and do well on exams. I would recommend taking it with Abbasi.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "B", "created": "2024-01-18T21:39:05.659324Z"}, {"professor": "Hossein Abbasi", "course": "ECON200", "review": "I absolutely loved this professor.

I would not recommend this as a gen ed unless you\u2019re business major or something along the lines of having this class mandatory. His classes were barely attend since he has a lot of resources posted on canvas and had pre recorded lectures. During class, he takes years on whatever topic he is yapping about and spends like 30 seconds on last on each side expecting you to get the concept down quickly and will end class not even halfway through the slides and moves on to the next chapter next class. Exams are exactly like the practice exams he posted but you really have to gasp the concepts and graphs down. I wish I took this at a cc and transferred it over but you just need a C- to pass with this class. He is also details oriented and will pay close attention to what you are doing on the work from what I heard from others.

He's kind and often attempts to crack jokes during his lectures (he reuses his \"coconut cookies \" joke at least once per lecture but it's endearing). Lectures can be pretty boring and the content from the lectures is the exact same as the content in the reading so I went to three lectures over the course of the semester and still got an A (note that I did the reading and homework really thoroughly, studied hard for my exams, and at times attended GSS meeting for topics I didn't understand). I appreciated that he was a really organized teacher and all the class content, slides, recording, hw, study sheets, etc. were categorized in canvas and super easy to find.

I find it difficult to pay attention but more often than not\u2014 you have to attend for the sake of learning the content. That is not the case with this class! He provides so many resources and is super helpful. He's a really nice guy and wants you to succeed and provides as much help as he can to make that happen. Talks really slowly which is helpful for people who take notes in class but not my cup of tea. He also has lecture VIDEOS with are very helpful\u2014 I watched those exclusively at 2x speed and it was helpful. All in all, even if you don't like his teaching skills\u2014 the resources he provides are unmatched. \r\n\r\nHomeworks: You have auto 100% homeworks and than the actual homeworks. Both of which are fairly easy, sometimes a bit time consuming but relatively simple to complete as long as you don't save it for the very last minute. Very doable as long as you read the textbook/attend class. \r\n\r\nEXAMS: Each midterm was sectioned off on the respective chapters you learnt prior to it. He makes sure you KNOW what you need to study and provides two practice exams (VERY HELPFUL).", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2024-03-13T18:34:12.323725Z"}], "name": "Hossein Abbasi", "slug": "abbasi"}
