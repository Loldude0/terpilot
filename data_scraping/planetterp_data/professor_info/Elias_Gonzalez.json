Any extension requests are always accepted and honored, his email is always open, very helpful during office hours, and is overall a great person. The class was pretty easy, as long as you put in effort you can get a good grade. The coding in the class is pretty basic and if you have a little background you'll be set, even if you don't the assignments are very doable and he always explains things in detail during class. The rest of the class is about the tech field and is still relatively interesting, but there is one section of the class that's done on code.org and it's not really that interesting in my opinion. This class was my first one that was about tech and he made it a better experience than I could've hoped for. The only complaint was that there always seemed to be issues with my grades being wrong and assignments not being able to be opened (we used google doc links for a lot of them), but that's partially due to the TA's. This was the most annoying part of the class, but it's an easy fix if you talk to him in class or over email, he'll usually regrade it and give points back.

If you are given a choice between Nelson and Gonzales, then it would be better to take Nelson anyway. \r\n\r\nGonzales for the entire semester wore a face mask, even when coming to lecture. Evidently he cared a great deal about the risk of COVID infection. Also evident was that he did not care about this enough for his students, because the office hours room was a windowless room in the AV Williams Building with no ventilation in which students were supposed to go to be crammed as sardines. If there was ever a greater risk of infection, it was this place. However much Gonzales cared about his own health, he did not care enough about that of his students to get a different room for them. \r\n\r\nWith regards to the projects, the only advantage over Nelson was that the first deadline would not cost you points if you missed it, but was rather just extra credit. However, the extra credit would barely be one or two points. I doubt that it would be enough to swing your grade by any significant amount either way. \r\n\r\nGonzales cannot lecture or teach well at all. His teaching style is terrible, with no continuous train of thought. \r\n\r\nHis slides are atrocious, with the code lacking basic things which he asks for in the same projects such as proper indentation and variable names. You are far better off using Nelson's slides for the subject. \r\n\r\nI stopped going to his in-person lectures early in the semester. I could not understand anything. He records his lectures anyway, so you can be confused at home instead of in the lecture hall.\r\n\r\nOffice hours were brutal and a complete mess. It was common to find a ten-person line of students for two TAs who were in attendance. \r\n\r\nIn any case, Gonzales would go to bat for his own TAs. He seemed to forget that this class was being run for the students and not for his teaching staff. He allowed them to cancel and reschedule their office hours however much they wanted.  You might end up in desperation at office hours, only to find out all the TAs cancelled last minute.\r\n\r\nBecause of the extreme latitude Gonzales gave his TAs, they abused it to the point where you would have days where there would be zero TAs at all, followed by days when there would be three or four TAs all at the same time. Never present when you actually needed them, of course. Most of the time, there would just be one brave TA (Dominic) holding down the fort reading through some crummy Google Doc office hours queue system instead of something respectable like the Quuly that Nelson used.\r\n\r\nOut of desperation I just stopped going to office hours. It was less effort for me to spend the weekend holed up in my room, than to waste time during the week trying to get a few minutes with a TA who would never show up. \r\n\r\nWhat was also frustrating was the sheer number of typos that Gonzales is capable of. During the final exam, he actually had to pause time for him to go through them. \r\n\r\nOn the second exam, he gave us some hashing question with some ridiculously large calculations. He realized that we were wasting our time on them and put up the values of the calculations on the projectors. Good luck if you were one of those people who had already wasted large amounts of time during the exam calculating things by hand. \r\n\r\nThis kind of flip-flopping and lack of consistency was typical. For instance, he allowed, then banned, then allowed again notes while doing the quizzes. \r\n\r\nGonzales provided little support for his exams. His \"practice questions\" would be mostly unrelated to the final exam and hopelessly RIDDLED with errors. You will spend more time trying to figure out what is wrong with the question than actually answering it.\r\n\r\nMost frustratingly of all, Gonzales always REFUSED to do the common-sense thing and provide answers to his own sample questions. He would constantly tell us to crowd-source answers on Piazza. Which of course, never happened. At least had past exams WITH SOLUTIONS that you could practice with which would make things dead easy. \r\n\r\nGonzales' communication was just very snarky and condescending in general, although he was decent enough in person. You will be going to him in person often, because he often does not resopnd to email. He would write things like \"as a treat for you all there will be no lecture today\". I wonder what that implies about his own evaluation of his own teaching. \r\n\r\nDiscussions were really depressing. My TA in particular would give a confusing explanation, then react sharply to the most innocent clarifications.", "rating": 2, "expected_grade": "B", "created": "2023-05-20T23:55:03.237755Z"}, {"professor": "Elias Gonzalez", "course": "CMSC125", "review": "Perhaps the most caring professor I've ever had.

He was a CS student here not too long ago, so he is understanding if you talk to him. Knowledgeable on the subject and generally prepared. Explains topics well. The projects aren't too bad, but it wouldn't hurt for him to be a little more specific at times. Same goes with the occasional poorly written test question. But I believe these are largely due to him being a newer teacher and I'm sure he will improve as time goes on.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-06-25T18:10:21.640869Z"}, {"professor": "Elias Gonzalez", "course": "CMSC132", "review": "Elias is a good person. And he is who you want if passing the class is all you care about. However, if you want to have a deep understanding of the content, you probably shouldn't go with him. He has a lot of positive reviews because people tend to remember not what you do but how you make them feel. Elias is a poor lecturer and made mistakes on nearly every exam and project we had. He was too lenient on the TAs to the point where most of them basically weren't doing their job. His study guides are also misleading. This is due to him adding topics to previous study guides and calling them new. For example, he had concepts from the beginning of the semester and even from 131 on the study guide for the 3rd midterm. And, big surprise, none of those old concepts were on the midterm. But everything on the study guide is \"fair game\" for the exam so it can be confusing to decide how you should spend your time studying. BUUUUUUUT, Elias has a really great personality and is EXTREMELY forgiving and just wants to see you succeed. He makes you feel good as a student. That's what people tend to remember. And that's why his reviews are so good. I would try to get him if you struggled in 131 or are still unsure about pursuing CS beyond 132.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "B", "created": "2023-11-01T20:14:52.912175Z"}, {"professor": "Elias Gonzalez", "course": "CMSC131", "review": "Elias is a great lecturer who explains all of the topics very thoroughly.

It does take a while for him and his TAs to grade certain assignments, but that's perhaps the only drawback I can think of.

Even though many other reviews seem to be shaky on Elias with his lecture style, frequent mistakes, glaring problems, etc, they seem to have been very much improved over this semester. While there were indeed still some typos on exams and quizzes, they were almost immediately addressed. Though while it would be better to see none, I assume it's going to be improved as time goes on as this is his second time teaching 131 (based on when reviews started for him). He is very humble, kind, funny, and like others have said, down-to-earth, especially being the product of UMD CS this past decade. Elias seems very passionate about teaching this course at his alma mater so I don't doubt his classes will only get better. His practice exams are extremely similar to the real exams, which have been very helpful studying tools!
