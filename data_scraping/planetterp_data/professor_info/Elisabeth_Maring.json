Her class is very easy-4 midterms, 6 online quizzes, and a few in class activities.  She also shares a lot of stories from her own experience parenting, which is very cute.\n\r\nHowever, I will add that she does dumb down course material quite a bit, and her lectures move very slowly.

It bugs me that all she does in the lecture videos are read from her pre-written notes and go through some slides. The course doesn't seem well prepared. There are a lot of assignments that are due every day and the instructions given are not clear enough. Unless you have no other choice, I recommend not to take this class with Dr. Maring, and not to take this class in general in the summer. I don't know how Dr. Maring expects students to read two entire books AND watch all her lecture videos, all while doing at least two assignments per day and interacting with other students for almost 15 days.

The class overall talked about both families and public health, but more public health. I could connect my learning to previous learning and it was so reinforcing. There were quizzes that were open note, lectures that were recorded, and a few assignments/discussions. We had a larger project where we interviewed a classmate and talked about our backgrounds. Great if you get a great partner!! Dr. Maring provides great and supportive feedback. The class will be challenging if you do not watch the videos, especially because the quizzes are based on them. The textbook/book wasn\u2019t necessary in my opinion. Would take again & would take another class with Dr. Maring!", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-08-19T20:58:45.025527Z"}, {"professor": "Elisabeth Maring", "course": "FMSC110S", "review": "Dr. Maring is an amazing professor!
