But, the class is basically analyzing films just like analyzing English literature. Basically, if you're good at English and love watching film, this is the class for you. Cote's lectures were discussion-based, but still enjoyable and informative, especially with film theory. As for the class's difficulty level, I would give ENGL245 with him a 3/5, since it's not necessarily hard, but work still needs to be put in to get a decent grade.

Though I took this class to fulfill a gen ed requirement, I'd definitely take more classes with him if I was more interested in English.\r\n\r\nFor 280, the structure with him worked like this:\r\n4(!) exams\r\n1 final\r\n1 paper proposal\r\n4 homework assignments\r\n5 online discussions\r\n\r\nthe midterms come quick, but they aren't hard. They're basically half multiple choice (super common sense questions, too), and half short answer or fill in the blank.\r\n\r\nThe final he was nice enough to make online as he figured it would help people do better on it, and openly said to feel free to use your notes or any other resource.\r\n\r\nThe paper proposal was his way of bringing some form of writing into the class, as this is a class on the history/structure of English rather than a literature or film class. We basically had to choose a topic that we talked about in class and think of a thesis that we could argue. We only had to write an abstract, and then also have two sources which we wrote an annotated bibliography for. Again, not hard at all.\r\n\r\nThe homeworks were essentially mini exams, honestly. Super easy and he would sometimes hint at what some of the answers were. The problems were super similar to things that we did in class, so there were no surprises.\r\n\r\nThe online discussions were kind of annoying, but not difficult. We had to write discussion posts on ELMS that were sometimes way too long for what the topic was (250 words for something that you can talk about in 3 sentences) so a lot of it ended up being fluff. Not hard, but kind of stupid.\r\n\r\nOverall this class was a 5/5 for me, especially with Cote.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2019-05-16T20:11:16Z"}, {"professor": "Paul Cote", "course": "ENGL101", "review": "Professor Cote's the best.

You will not regret it. He genuinely cares about his students and does everything in his power to make the course as easy and stress-free as possible. 85% of the course is graded pass/fail based on completion, and the other 15% is graded based on effort, not perfection. He never expects perfection, so as long as he can see that you put effort into the assignment, you will get a 100. And due dates are not strict an there is no penalty for turning in assignments late, so you could turn in every assignment on the last day of class and still get a 100 in the class. Paul (he says we are allowed to call him by his first name) really is the sweetest man. He frequently ends class early if he thinks most students in the class are tired or stressed out, and there is very little work in his class compared to other ENGL101 classes. What's more is he spent a couple sessions talking to us about how he can make the class even easier than it already is, and he eliminated two or three papers and extended due dates. And his feedback on papers are very uplifting. In his feedback for my papers he always emphasizes that my writing and analysis was extremely impressive, and then he follows it up with constructive feedback in a very non-harsh way. And he has a great sense of humor, which makes classes very entertaining. I actually don't want the semester to end because I don't want to never see him again.
