SHe really showed she cared about you and was super understanding and accomadating if you simply needed extra time to complete an assignment. The Class itself is super easy and I actually enjoyed it and it kinda made me interested in the possibility of getting a master certification in Math. It honestly is super hard to not pass this class.
