She was constantly making sure that we were doing okay when crazy things were happening over the semester in the outside world. She was extremely understanding and caring and flexible when it came to our circumstances and even those that were not in our control. She also disseminated information that was relevant to psych/neuro that we may be interested in. She was also really organized with all of the material when teaching an online class. The way the course topics were broken up into (memory, emotion, motor, etc) also followed the order of the chapters in the book. Also, many of the graphics and information that were presented in the lecture were also taken straight from the book. For these reasons, I would recommend using the book as a supplemental resource to look at things that you did not understand from the lecture. We had three exams that were pretty easy and were not a big chunk of your grade. We had about four reflection assignments in which we had to either watch or read about something and write a short (about a page) answering some questions on the rubric that was mainly opinion based. I really enjoyed these because the topics were on things like ethics and racial issues in the field of neuroscience. Every Friday we had synchronous classes in which we usually spent the time going over a research article either in groups or as a whole class. There were low-stake assignments accompanied by these that we completed during the class. The most important thing to take note of is the semester project. There is no final exam in the class it is just your final project. This can definitely take a big punch to your grade as it did mine. Make sure to put effort into it early on in the semester so that when it comes time to your final, it will be one less thing to worry about. Dr. Chicoli has set it up in a great way in which she breaks down the project into different parts that have different deadlines. This way, you are working on it slowly throughout the semester and when it comes down to the final you don't have to stress. I had an A+ the entire semester but was so crammed during finals week that when I was working on the final project during the allotted two-hour window, I did not finish one part of the project in time. I scored a 100% on every other part of the project but because that one part was worth a good amount of points, it bumped my final grade down from an A+ to an A. So I would definitely recommend not taking three finals back to back in one day and manage your time. Overall, I would absolutely recommend this class with Dr.Chicoli no matter the circumstance. The class may sound intimidating but the way that she has structured it and the way she is as a person is definitely catered towards student success.

Some students think that \"active learning sessions\" are a bit of a time-waster but it was very beneficial to my understanding of the concepts by being able to work through the concepts in a different manner aside from the lecture slides. She allotted us one hour each week to work with peers and teaching staff to answer and understand the assigned questions.

Of all the professors I've had at UMD, she is the only one I can confidently say will email you back within the day or at least 24 hours, no matter what for. below are some bullet points\r\n\r\n- take notes in class and read over the textbook briefly for a better understanding of the topics. sometimes for the exams you need a little bit more of an understanding than what is on the lecture slides\r\n- go to class and ask questions. interact with her more than once or twice and she'll learn your name hands down. ive gotten to know her a lot and it truly feels like a person-to-person teaching experience. \r\n- if you are struggling on a topic... just ask her to explain it again in office hours or after class, she won't bite, and she's not mean. she will gladly explain it to you because she really does love the material. \r\n\r\nTips I wish I knew starting out that I use now:\r\n- for content, maybe break it into categories such as... Anatomy, function of each area discussed, pathways/circuits, and pathology. these are the main groups of information she gives you. the act of active-categorization is also proven to be one of the top learning methods (just google scholar active-categorization if you want a reference)\r\n- use anki or other active recall methods like quizlet. im telling you do NOT JUST READ OVER NOTES for these exams. I did for the first one and didn't get a good grade, but did on subsequent ones by using anki. a side note if you want a leg up on some exams is to make sure you use the practice quizzes that she provides you, just do it you'll see why. \r\n- you dont need to study every single day, but several times a week is probably a good idea as you have exams basically every 3 weeks. \r\n- ASK QUESTIONS ON THE MIDSEMESTER PROJECTS AND SCHEDULE APPTS TO GO OVER WHAT YOU HAVE. I misread the rubric on the first project and got a C, it was bad. but for the second I made an appointment with a TA to review it a day before the deadline and it turned out much better. \r\n- take time to actually understand every single graph or picture she gives you, especially the ones that involve an experiment. they will be on the exam in one way or another trust me. \r\n\r\nBasically she's a really good professor, just make sure to connect the dots on your own, and do work outside of the class. it's a 3 credit class so expect to put in around 3-5 hours of work outside class a week minimum including assignments and studying.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A-", "created": "2023-04-20T12:20:48.558666Z"}, {"professor": "Amanda Chicoli", "course": "PSYC207", "review": "Dr. Chicoli is such a bubbly and fun person.

So, I thought to give me review of opinions, and I hope to give you some perspective through the process. First off, Dr. Chicoli is really nice as a person always willing to help, but you have to be the one to reach out to her, especially if you are falling behind. She is pretty good at learning names, even amongst about 100 students, and she tries to be as personable as possible in a larger setting. She is good at taking questions, and wants to strengthen our understanding of neuroscience. I will not lie, her exams are hard to ace with full points (I believe there was one MCQ as a part of a test where no one was able to score full points), but she gives you an extra credit opportunity of 5 points, which can boost your grade up to the next letter grade). The exams are mostly MCQ with some FRQ, and the FRQ is easy to score on. This semester, some of her announcements for new assignments were hard to reach, but she was able to listen to our feedback and changed a project to be announced earlier. Expect to work several hours outside the class, as it is assignment heavy as well. You can definitely learn lots about neural circuits, and can definitely ace the class if you have an interest toward the subject.

Lectures would try to match lab content but often did not follow a logical flow (sometimes we'd jump back to old content for an entire lecture out of nowhere, then jump back to the actual lab content the next lecture which became very confusing). My TA while sweet seemed to be just as unsure what we should be doing in our assignments as we were. I was lucky to have a section later on in the week but other students I met with earlier sections would mention that at points labs would do activities on topics that would not be introduced in lecture until later in the week. I received contradictory information from my professor and my TA on multiple occasions and had to put extra effort into communicating with both to make sure I wasn't being told the wrong thing. Although my personal experience with this class was frustrating-- Professor Chicoli is a good lecturer, and I will say that she was very accommodating to the unfortunate loss we had this semester and some of the changes she made to the schedule to accommodate may have been a cause for some of this disorganized feeling. \r\n\r\nBesides the lack of organization which may have just been semester-specific; Grading in this class would take excessively long, which is an inconvenience for some assignments but genuinely a problem for research papers, where the course is designed to have students make a rough draft and update it through the feedback they receive. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this class felt much harder than it had to be considering the actual content of the course was not that advanced.", "rating": 2, "expected_grade": "A-", "created": "2024-01-11T03:52:13.057951Z"}, {"professor": "Amanda Chicoli", "course": "PSYC207", "review": "She was probably the worst professor I have ever had in all four years at Maryland. She was not accommodating at all, never explained complex terms or theories in class before using them in lectures and expecting us to know how to apply them in exams, and made the exams much too hard - half the exam was open ended, five + part questions regarding things she hardly mentioned during lecture. Her lecture style was so confusing and all over the place. She also never seemed to be organized or ready for the topic of the day. Honestly horrible experience I wish I could go back and never have taken this course.
