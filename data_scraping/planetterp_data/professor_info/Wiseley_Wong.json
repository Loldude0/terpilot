Were you a fan of the professor's teaching style? \r\n\u00b7 I enjoyed the professor's lecture style. \r\n\u00b7 It was important to attend in person (and be on time) to catch hints about what would be covered in exams and quizzes. \r\n\u00b7 The hand-written notes on the chalkboard were helpful, and I recommend taking occasional notes on his verbal explanations as well. \r\n\u00b7 Wiseley was patient and took the time to fully answer questions, even if they seemed basic. \r\n\u2014\r\n4. Was the workload appropriate for the number of credits? \r\n\u00b7 The workload was relatively relaxed.
