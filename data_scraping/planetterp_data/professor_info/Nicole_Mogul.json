She creates a great atmosphere every lecture, and it's a nice change of pace from all of the equations and circuits that we have to deal with in every other major requirement course. Interesting lectures, including a lot of video content, and a lot of thought-provoking conversatio about Ethics in Engineering. Great class!\n\nShort essay due every week (Friday night for my class), but they're pretty simple to do. There is a bit of reading to do for the class, but that's just characteristic of ENEE200. Nicole pushed her final to the last day of class so that there wasn't a final during finals week, so that was nice. She also handed out candy the class before halloween, which was also nice.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2015-11-13T08:06:00Z"}, {"professor": "Nicole Mogul", "course": "ENEE200", "review": "Nicole is great. Initially I thought having engineers taking an ethics class was kind of ridiculous, but after taking her class I have to say that if anyone was going to make the class worthwhile it's her. She creates an excellent atmosphere in the classroom that encourages people to participate and think in a new way. She is passionate about the material, and that passion translates to everyone else in the class. The class is not very much work and her expectations are totally reasonable. I'm really glad that I took this class with Dr. Mogul and I hope that more people get the opportunity to take this class with her.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2014-12-03T21:09:00Z"}, {"professor": "Nicole Mogul", "course": "ENEE200", "review": "Fine lady honestly.

Honestly, this class is a lot of writing and extremely easy, but it was a struggle to take her seriously during lectures, especially when she cuts of students answers mid-sentence, embarrassingly directs her anger at the Assistant Dean of the Engineering IT Staff for her technology not working, and for her ridiculously useless assignments.

ENEE200 is a waste of time and a big one at that. You are assigned 2+ readings/videos a week that simultaneously say nothing interesting and talk down to you. The authors are either nobodies, overrated academia stars, or both. You are also assigned 2 to 3 writing assignments a week, sometimes due the same day that they are assigned (so good luck if you had any other plans Thursday night cause that assignment needs to get done). Expect to put in 2-3 hours+ a week of your own time into this time waster that just leaves you irritated after completing the assignments filled with condescending questions that you have to answer. If being \u201cwoke\u201d was a major, this would be a core requirement.\r\n\r\nClass time itself is a mess. Lectures and discussions are mandatory (of course). You learn nothing and are instead divided into groups to discuss whatever ridiculous question is posted on the board, while the professor walks around and somehow contributes a negative amount to your group when she comes to speak with you. Discussions are somehow even more pointless, we\u2019re asked to do these ridiculous activities like copying the actions your partner does, or writing down what your anthropomorphized phone you\u2019ll say to you. Discussion activities are humiliating and degrading. We\u2019re in college not kindergarten for God\u2019s sake!\r\n\r\nOnly plus side is that as long as you turn in assignments and attend lecture and discussion, you will get an A. But I urge you to take a class that\u2019s actually interesting, or at least any professor that isn\u2019t Mogul, who is the least interesting, most shallow, and most unintelligent person I\u2019ve run into during my time at UMD. Is it really an easy A if you need to put in 6+ hours a week into it, if you count lecture, discussion, and impromptu assignments? I think that the only reason Mogul is still around is that the material she\u2019s pushing the -20 IQ slogans that academia has come to love in recent years.
