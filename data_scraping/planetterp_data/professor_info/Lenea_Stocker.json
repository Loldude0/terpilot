Dr. Stocker got stuck teaching every single one of the 21 sections of chem 135 offered fall 2020. As a result, it was nearly impossible to get individual help from her or the TAs, leaving many students to turn (unsuccessfully) to GSS. Dr. Stocker also all but banned students from emailing her directly, which seems harsh at first, but after reading so many stupid questions in the groupmes from people who were just oblivious to the syllabus or her emails, seems fair. Also as a result of all the sections, Dr. Stocker released lectures MWF (even for people who signed up for TuTh sections, but it was pre recorded, so whatever), and the TAs moved their discussion times.\r\nTeaching style: The lectures themselves were pretty good. All were pre recorded and uploaded to panopto, and she tended to stick within the 50 minute time frame. They could be a bit boring at times, and a bit heavy on organic chemistry (she wants to be an orgo teacher, and it shows), but overall better than what you'd expect considering the rest of the class. The discussions were lowkey useless, and I started skipping pretty early on. Dr. Stocker also released practice sets for every topic. DO THEM!!!\r\nGrading: The chem department likes to give impossible tests and then a crazy curve, and Stocker is no exception. My 82% turned into an A. Unfortunately, info about the curve is very poorly communicated. She doesn't release estimates of final grade cutoffs. After each exam, she releases 2 sample grade cutoffs. One tells you an estimated letter grade of the exam you just took, based on points. These give students the illusion of hope, since exam grades tend to have means around 50-60%, but since only the overall grade is curved, these are functionally useless. The other set of grade cutoffs tells you your estimated letter grade in the class as of that exam. For some reason, she makes you manually add up points on just some assignments, instead of just using the percentages that elms auto generates. It's just annoying.\r\nExams: Since Stocker had 800 students, she couldn't manually grade exams. Instead, she used the quiz feature on elms to give exams that were all multiple choice/drop down/check all/etc. Anything that could auto grade. This meant you got your grade instantly, but there was no partial credit. All exams were on an insane time crunch designed to make the averages low. Exams were given at 7 PM EST, regardless of section, unless you had another class at that time. She didn't proctor the exams (too many students for zoom), which led to more creative (read: annoying) ways to catch cheating.\r\nThe cheating allegations: THIS IS WHAT BROKE THE CLASS!!! Exam 2 had 2 bait questions, where she gave a real chemical name, but changed the formula. This was designed to catch students googling answers. Unfortunately, a tiny mistake on the math and/or a miscount could get you the same answer as google. Every student who got the google answer was reported to OSC for cheating, and their cases were still being processed even after finals. All in all, 152 students got accused of cheating.

She is such an amazing professor and makes organic chemistry much more manageable to learn. She is very charismatic and genuinely likes helping students (meaning: go to her office hours!!). Compared to other Orgo I professors, she actually is far less technical and legitimately doesn't expect students to know as much material. This makes things a lot easier; you still learn a LOT of content, but it's less than other professors will teach (especially Dixon). Her lectures are definitely fast-paced, but that's just the nature of orgo. I would recommend writing down every single thing she says during lecture. Like, everything. It's really helpful when you go back through your notes and you have her comments written down, because sometimes just looking at the stuff she wrote down doesn't fully explain every concept. She will mention a lot of really helpful details/tips and tricks. She likes to try and explain concepts, especially the more difficult ones, in multiple ways to try and accommodate for the fact that every student is going to understand things a little differently. If you don't understand something from lecture, just go to her office hours, she will help. Her office hours tend to get a bit crowded, especially close to exams, but that's not really her fault, just come to office hours prepared with your questions (or you can sit in them just to listen to other people's questions, I know some people did that).\r\n\r\nHer exams are also pretty fair. They're not easy exams by any means, but they don't ask questions beyond what we learn in class. The midterms are designed to have a time-crunch, which can be tough. She also posts practice exams for every midterm on ELMS, which I would definitely check out. Her exams are typically formatted the same way every semester, so they're a good way of seeing what kinds of questions to expect. She doesn't post keys for them though, you have to go to office hours and ask about specific questions. She also has MANY problem sets on ELMS, and those have answer keys. I would absolutely recommend going through those, both as supplemental work alongside lectures and as exam review. They have several examples of problems for every concept you learn in that class. \r\n\r\nThere are also a handful of homework worksheets in the class, which are the only grades aside from the exams. The homework really won't budge your grade that much, but they're useful for practicing content. The grade for the homeworks is split in two, with turning in a homework answer sheet for 3 points and a quiz that pulls random questions from the homework worksheet that is 12 points. In total, each homework assignment is worth 15 points. Turning in the (completed) answer sheet gets you an automatic 3 points (that part is just graded on completion) and the quiz is graded on accuracy. If you are confused on any homework, I'd go to office hours or ask your TA. I also think it's really helpful to find a group of friends in that class, it definitely helped me a lot this last semester (Fall 2021).\r\n\r\nStocker's lectures are straightforward and fast. Sometimes, her organization does get a little confusing. She won't always be clear on exactly what she is teaching and how it connects to a previous concept. This never really impacted the quality of her lectures too much, but she usually posted her lecture slides and had a lecture schedule on ELMS, which would help with organization. Even though orgo is hard, I really enjoyed her class. She is a great professor and made lectures enjoyable (she's pretty funny, and uses her cats/sons as analogies ALL the time lol). The curve is always nice in this class and the key to doing well is getting above average on each exam. I was very scared of orgo (I'm not good at chemistry), but orgo involved very, very little math and is almost entirely conceptual. The content is not too challenging, it's just a matter of keeping up with the pace of the class. I would recommend memorizing functional groups and pKas VERY early. Also, making flashcards or a comprehensive list of all of the reaction mechanisms as you go is super useful. This class is more memorization than Stocker will claim, but as long as you start memorizing/self-assessing early, then you will be set. \r\n\r\nOverall, I would 1,000% recommend Dr. Stocker.

On the plus side, she let me help choose the final exam's meme for the front page! But in terms of her class here are a few bullet points. \r\n\r\n- Go to lecture. This semester I missed one lecture and I fell behind for a few days, but because I had someone record it for me and send the notes I was fine for the exam. All of the material you are tested on is in lecture. if you don't understand something in lecture, simply raise your hand and ask. she doesn't shame you, she doesn't act like youre a burden. she will simply try her best to answer your question and confirm that she answered it well. If for some reason you still don't understand the topic, go to her many office hours and read the supporting material in the textbook. If you understand the material in class, don't bother with the textbook whatsoever. \r\n\r\n- Grading: Stocker uses the class average to set cutoffs for grade estimates. I have yet to see final grade estimates, but I'm sure she will be very fair. Her goal is not to make a low average!!! in fact she congratulates the class for achieving high averages. You can expect her to be very fair and reasonable with grade cutoffs, and they are almost always somewhat curved but only to represent an even distribution of grades. I am in-between an A- and a B+, but I'm not stressed. I feel that the grade I am getting is due to my studying and not due to Stocker's grading criteria. In sum, try your best and you will be proud of your grade. \r\n\r\n- Lecture style: Stocker is the ABSOLUTE BEST LECTURER I have ever seen. She emphasizes similar reactions rather than grouping of the same category of reactions, which helps a lot in learning similar mechanisms. She doesn't rush you. If the class is behind on a topic for an exam, she won't rush to pack it in, she'll simply take it out of the exam. this rarely happened for us. \r\n\r\n- Exam style: Expect a certain level of cumulative topics, but she won't surprise you with something that isn't important for your current material. For example, pKa's, you will learn, are extremely important for every topic in organic chemistry 1, and you can expect to see her have 3pts per exam at least dedicated to pKa's. you can expect roughly 1/4 of the exam to be easy questions, 2/4 mid-range questions that challenge you but are certainly possible, and 1/4 challenging / high point-value questions. these fractions are based off of points towards your exam grade. I earned a B+, B+, and A- on the three exams and have yet to take the final. I did average in general chemistry 1, so please don't get too scared about Orgo with Stocker. \r\n\r\nI was going to make a pro's and con's list for Dr. Stocker but decided to do a bullet list of all of the good things you should know. The only bad thing I saw about the class was that it's HUGE, and people tend to talk a little loud in her class so I would sit in the front if I were you. There is nothing bad I can even think of with Stocker. She has a low rating because she found out a lot of people were cheating a few years before this review and did what was in her job description as a lecturer and reported them. Seriously don't cheat guys. It may seem like it will help you but I mean this when I say that your'e risking far more than what you could possibly ever gain from cheating. You can also get an A without cheating!!! \r\n\r\nto wrap up this already long review, I wanted to just stronglyyyy urge you to take stocker even if you have to rearrange your schedule completely. You will NOT regret it and maybe if you do, you can meet her kids who are almost as sweet and fun as she is. Best of luck in orgo! don't get intimidated by it, just work hard and you'll be fine.

This may just be an issue with my section as I haven't heard of averages this high from present and past students. Although the semester hasn't ended and we don't know the cutoffs for the final, the cutoffs for an A before was an 87 which is barely a curve. I am averaging around a B/B- in the class which would likely be at least an A- in any other orgo class except for this one. While this was an annoying issue in my class and prevented many students from getting the grade they wanted I will still say she is a good professor.

She's an absolute sweetheart who glows when she teaches organic chemistry. It's great seeing someone passionate about the topic teach it. She also uses a lot of animal references to help with understanding and a meme on every single exam. I can happily say I adore her. As others said, my biggest regret is probably not being able to form a bond with her earlier on. In terms of the lecture, Stocker tended to speed through information and you were essentially REQUIRED to go to class. No zoom option, no lecture recordings, slides with almost 0 information being posted. GO TO CLASS or find friends who will give you their notes. Even with that, she's still an incredible professor.\r\nNow into the schmeat of orgo....\r\nOrgo at first seems incredibly terrifying, especially with the amount of memorization required to understand a lot of it.  Stocker provides a lot of practice work and old exams to get you through that so you can recognize what she uses. She doesn't post the answer keys for old exams, but it encourages everyone to work together or to go to office hours for it. She does have homework as well, which is honestly harder than the exams but students always tend to work together through zoom calls prior to when it's due. She drops the lowest one (which was below a 50 for me) but still keeps the points from them in the final grade. \r\nHer exams themselves are very similar to the old exams, however, there always seems to be that ONE trick question. My biggest mistake was taking the first exam thinking I didn't need to study that much. YOU DO NEED TO STUDY FOR ORGO. I scored (with the grade ranges she posted) a low C for the first exam, high Bs for the second two, and a pretty low B for the final. I can absolutely blame myself for the first exam because I didn't really worry about it too much. I mainly thought I could just ride the curve for orgo, but my class tended to have 65s and up as their averages for exams, which is higher than usual for Stocker and made it impossible for me to just ride the curve.\r\nIf you're struggling, I highly suggest watching Leah4Sci on youtube for help!

Understand that orgo is HARD and DIFFERENT from what you may have learned before (like learning a language) and you may need to practice a lot more as these classes are the fundamental base for future classes. Utilize all your available resources (practice sets, previous exams, GSS, office hours) to your advantage and make sure you understand the mechanisms and why they are happening. Try to make friends with people to form study groups and help each other doing the past exams that don't have answer keys.

I would first  scan my notebook (make sure you label when exam 1, 2, and 3 start/end) to see if I there is something I don't recognize. If I find a reaction I don't recognize, I rewrite it and try to write out the mechanism and repeat until I can do it without looking back to my notebook. Once I'm decently familiar with the material I do a past exam (without a key) with a 50 min timer. The material on the exam I didn't know how to do, I would do the practice set for them. I also spend time trying to figure out if my answers were correct using my notebook. I repeat doing past exams and checking with my notebook until I can do most of it. I like to leave the exam with the answer key at the very end because by then I should be confident enough to do well on that exam and confirm my answers. Also if you don't go to GSS normally, I would highly recommend you at the very least go to GSS exam review sessions as it's essentially just doing a past exam with an answer key. Be aware that the test formatting for Dr. Stocker is almost the same every time, so the past exams will give you an idea how the current exam will look like.
