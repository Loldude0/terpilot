Classes mostly consist of discussing readings, but since there are no grades that rely on having you read the readings you don't really have to do the readings.\r\n+ Prof, all in all, is pretty chill. Even if you miss assignments, just talk to him and you can normally reach an arrangement\r\n+ Also I guess he's changed a lot from December 2017, he allowed us to have laptops in class\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Essays are very anecdote-based, if you're used to writing research papers, get ready for some whiplash", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2021-12-24T19:03:25Z"}, {"professor": "Jesse Brooks", "course": "ENGL398V", "review": "I loved him! I feel like my writing improved so much in this course, he focuses on straying from regular cut-and-dry rubrics (which was hard for me), but really helps with writing and expressing ideas/communicating in general. Really loved the content of this course, if you're looking for a professional writing course to take, I'd highly recommend 398V (especially with Jesse). Great course and great professor!

This was advertised as a professional writing class, writing about the environment, but we aren't really doing any writing to prepare us for respective professional fields, unless you're maybe doing journalism or advocacy work where creative writing comes in handy.
