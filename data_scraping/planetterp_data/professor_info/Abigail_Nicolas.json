The class itself is relatively easy if you stay on track. The issue is that Dr. Abi does less than the bare minimum in terms technological layout for the class. She overcomplicates whenever possible, and is unsupportive when needed to provide some support. for example, despite every professor or teacher I have ever had putting assignments on the calendar so students are reminded about a due date, or at least putting a due date on the assignment in the elms \"assignments\" page, she decided that she was above this and refused to set these up leading multiple students to lose over 10% of their grade because of human mistakes. Her justification was because the due dates were in the atrocity of a layout that she called a syllabus. For a counselor and teacher who tells people to be lenient towards themselves, she is not lenient towards her students. \r\n\r\nThe class - that is the pre-made curriculum she regurgitates - itself is good, and I have learned some useful things but for me who relies on technology and having things organized normally, she comes nowhere near the bar that is set in terms of how almost every other professor in the university arranges their course. \r\n\r\nShe isn't a monster, or a bad professor, her teaching style just suffers from the following:\r\n- the inability to build an organized syllabus, assignment prompt, elms page, lecture format/slide layout...\r\n- snappy responses to genuine and understandable questions people have during lecture such as \"this could be easily addressed by maybe looking at the syllabus but since you already asked...\"\r\n- lack of due-date reminders except for in-class 0.5 second remarks that aren't even on the slides\r\n- a terrible grading scheme with VERY LITTLE  room for error, though the grades aren't harsh. \r\n- the inability for her to keep students engaged during a zoom-based class despite it being the norm for years for most people. \r\n\r\npros:\r\n- easy A if you put the effort in. the bulk of assignments are relatively easy\r\n- good if you want to skip therapy and learn positive psychology directly from the source for whatever reason. it genuinely helped me because I hate going to therapy\r\n- TA Michael is really great and provides great feedback and is open to answering literally any question you have.", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-03-08T22:37:59.368675Z"}, {"professor": "Abigail Nicolas", "course": "PSYC100", "review": "this class was such a mess. my psyc section was completely on zoom, so dr. abi would constantly get distracted and wouldn't stay on track. perhaps her in person classes are better, but don't take her online", "rating": 2, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-05-09T15:21:22.914414Z"}, {"professor": "Abigail Nicolas", "course": "PSYC234", "review": "Super easy course and she is an amazing professor.
