All of the assignments (which included a map quiz, definition quiz, midterm, and final paper) were graded fairly and related directly to the course material. As long as you put effort into the assignments, an A is definitely achievable. Dr. Schine's lectures were very easy to follow and contained a lot of interesting information. Attendance in lectures isn't crucial as she posts the slides to ELMS, but I would recommend attending still as she's a great lecturer, and attendance is taken for discussion. Dr. Schine is also very sweet and understanding, and very knowledgable about Islamic history, so I would definitely recommend taking her for this course.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-01-07T08:53:10.885652Z"}, {"professor": "Rachel Schine", "course": "AASP498U", "review": "She's amazing. She's so understanding about literally everything and her lectures are so interesting. She makes you want to know what else she has to say. Also, she is very accurate in her teachings and makes sure that the people she is teaching are all heard and understood. The poets, authors, artists, etc. There are times when it is hard to understand certain assignments, but all you have to do is ask and she will help you. If you need an extension, she'll give it to you. You just have to talk to her. Attendance isn't mandatory but I recommend you go.

She is super understanding regarding assignments but I needed that understanding because the structure of the class is not great. Lectures feel just like the teacher is talking at you and provided slides are super hard to follow and badly formatted. Many times I feel like I am behind in the class and truly just have to self study the material. Also, the structure of the class is weird and I am always confused on information such as structure of exams.

I went into HIST120 not entirely sure what to expect (it was my second choice for a gen ed) and found that I had accidentally struck gold. If you're interested in history, even if you know nothing about the Islamic world, I can almost guarantee you will enjoy this class. Lectures are a solid 50 minutes of Professor Schine enthusiastically teaching you about that day's topic. She often had so much to say that we wouldn't finish the slides, but that was totally fine, because none of the assignments or exams relied on you being able to know every bit of information, and it never seemed like she was rushing any of the core aspects of the course. I personally loved just absorbing as much information as possible, especially when she would go on small tangents and give you fun facts. She is clearly passionate about teaching and enjoys lecturing, and is super friendly and approachable. Assignments and exams were never too hard (although they did involve some studying to be confident on), and the only part of the course I actively disliked was the term paper. Even that, though, was interesting in its own right, as I got to do research on a topic of my choice. Overall 10/10, will be looking to take a class with her in the future.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2024-01-30T22:04:31.202979Z"}], "name": "Rachel Schine", "slug": "schine_rachel"}
