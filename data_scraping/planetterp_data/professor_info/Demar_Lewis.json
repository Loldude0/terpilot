Also, do not take this class if you are expecting to talk about the criminal justice system or specific problems pertaining to race, because you won\u2019t. For each class (so twice a week) there are readings, usually 2-3 that are around 30 pages. Often times, these readings are briefly mentioned in lecture, but you don\u2019t need to read them to understand what he\u2019s talking about. The entire class so far has been about realizing the social constructs in place in this world. Dr. Lewis is very nice and passionate about his work though which does help. \r\nThere is a group podcast assignment that is briefly explained and he does not give you any time to even find your group members in the class, which multiple classmates agree would have been helpful. There is also a paper to go with this. He neglects to mention when this assignment is due because it was only talked about one time. There was also criminological debates and the same thing applies to this as well: he expects you to find the instructions and does not give you time to meet your group members. Finally, there are in-class assignments, but he does not give you time in class to work on them. \r\nOverall, I would not recommend this class because we never talk about the criminal justice system directly and there is an overwhelming amount of work.", "rating": 2, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2024-03-13T20:48:24.760736Z"}], "name": "Demar Lewis", "slug": "lewis"}
