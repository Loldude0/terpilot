Dr. Powlison is a super nice professor, probably one of my favorite ones I've had! Her and the TA's were very responsive to student concerns and accessible for feedback. You can get away with skipping lecture sometimes but she did make them fun. Attending discussion was mandatory for participation and we had a discussion post due each week. You definitely need to at least skim the textbook for the weekly online quizzes (open note though) and for the final exam but overall a decently easy A as long as you study and start the final project early!", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2022-09-28T15:24:00.072815Z"}, {"professor": "Nicole Powlison", "course": "MUSC210", "review": "Dr.Powlison is super nice but this is not an easy gen ed.

There are A LOT of terms and definitions that you need to memorize, and the exams are not easy because the questions could be about a range of terms that were said during any of her lectures. This is not an easy A, so don't expect to breeze through this class without at least putting some effort into studying or reviewing the lectures. There is a check-in for every lecture, which you have to take during class to get credit. There is one music experience interview, which is about 1,500-2000 words. There are 3 exams, which you will not pass unless you actually study the content that she lectured about. Her study guides basically just list every topic and term she discussed in all of her lectures, which is pointless when it comes to knowing what will be on the exam. Discussions really just depend on your TA, and mine was very chill fortunately.

She does her best to try and engage the class, but it's just tough when the content is so obscure most of the time.
