He genuinely cares about his students, and he is generally a very laid-back and chill person. There are no exams for the course, but there are 4-3-2-1 essay quizzes every other week that sound like a lot of work, but if you put in the effort, they are not hard at all. If you fall behind on one, there is a 1 week grace period after the due date that you can use. The material is very interesting and for the most part, quite easy to follow. Professor Mueller is also funny and loves telling jokes at the beginning of class. Take this class with him, you will not regret it!", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2024-03-29T14:23:31.221107Z"}], "name": "Collin Mueller", "slug": "mueller_collin"}
