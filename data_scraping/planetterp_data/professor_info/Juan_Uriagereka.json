He knows what he is talking about but he cannot teach because he is too smart to explain the main ideas of the class. Half the time the TA for this class had to intervene and save us from being totally and completely lost. Also, in his syllabus participation is only 10%, but do not let this fool you. He has no method for recognizing participation, and if he 'feels' like you didn't talk enough, he will drop you an entire letter grade.

He is a very kind and understanding professor. The way he structured this course was unorthodox with half the semester done completely around one research project led by a TA and done with a few other members. This research project also includes a presentation and a showcase. He is fairly relaxed with due dates and he often lets us choose the direction that the course takes, for example, he let us come up with the essay questions for our final(two 500 word essays). This is not a difficult course as long as you and your group members do your work.

The course began with lectures that leaned towards philosophy and \"why is it the way it is?\" discussions. It's not bad, but it doesn't encapsulate the projects we did later in the semester. The grader for the class is a woman who, from my experience, is like those teachers that dock points for expressing the \"wrong\" point of view. Her grading style is interesting to say the least. There is also rarely a rubric.\r\nOverall the course covered interesting topics, but the material was confusing and homepage difficult to navigate.", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "A-", "created": "2023-12-29T05:16:11.059883Z"}], "name": "Juan Uriagereka", "slug": "uriagereka"}
