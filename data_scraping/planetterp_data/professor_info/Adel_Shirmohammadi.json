The math is very basic, but getting a conceptual understanding is another situation. The major issue with the content in this course is sifting through all the babbling in lecture for what is usable information. Every minute spent sitting in this class feels like a waste of time when you can click through the powerpoint in 10 minutes and find the equations you need and tables that will be referenced. He loosely set up a Canvas page after a few weeks, but then insisted he already was doing the most he could when we asked if we could submit a pdf. God forbid he take an online submission. Instead, he more than once misplaced a student's homework and then told them in front of the class that they hadn't turned it in. Using a student as an example like that is a blatant misuse of power especially when it's his mistake. Dr. Shirmohammadi made a habit of only presenting his expectations and heavy dissatisfaction with the class's performance after handing back graded assignments, and you are absolutely kidding yourself if you expect to see a rubric provided on any assignment all semester.  He frequently went on long rants about the lack of effort from students and his disdain for students being late, and sometimes called them out by name and said \u201cdon\u2019t bother coming\u201d for being merely 5 minutes late. I can't remotely recommend this class or professor, and it has certainly been the worst class I've taken within the department.", "rating": 2, "expected_grade": "B+", "created": "2023-05-20T12:22:30.454789Z"}], "name": "Adel Shirmohammadi", "slug": "shirmohammadi"}
