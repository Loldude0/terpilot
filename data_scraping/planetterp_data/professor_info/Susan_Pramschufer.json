I was only mildly interested at first because I didn't recognize many of the movies, but by the end of the semester I've grown to appreciate each one for what it's taught me about american landscape in film. The class is structured where you watch one or two movies a week outside of class with maybe one discussion post, and then the class is a lecture format with lots of chance for class discussion. I loved this format for many reasons: I got to have movie nights with my roomies, I had time to think about the film by myself before class, and it was easy to pay attention in class because I could participate. And if participation isn't your thing, she doesn't grade it. The two essays were short, easy, and interesting.

At the beginning of the semester, you watch several movies, focusing on different models of disability and then you do discussion posts (like 5 times). After that, no more discussion posts, which is gold to me. There are three big essays you'd have to do. An observation, scene analysis, and restatement project. Towards the ending of the semester, you'd choose a specific scene from any movie with aspects of disability in it and \"remake\" that scene to be more progressive than it is now. You do either a storyboard or a script, depending on what is your scene. Anyway, the overall course is kind of interesting, especially coming from a disabled student like me. I don't agree with some stuff that is mentioned in this course. The film class basically says that movies or we should reject patriarchal, white, straight, and male hegemony. Cultural hegemony should be rejected.  If you are a conservative, then you might not like this course??? \r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Pramschufer is an extremely helpful teacher.
