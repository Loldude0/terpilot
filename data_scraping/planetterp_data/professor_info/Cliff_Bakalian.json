Sadly, Cliff's lecture style left something to be desired. He usually seemed to prioritize covering as many slides as possible as opposed to focusing on the fundamentals. For example, one week we had a PowerPoint nearly 70 slides long - Cliff blasted through as fast as he could, and many of the pertinent examples provided he would go \"I don't care about this,\" and skip straight past them. Consequently, by the time we got to more complicated topics, I was lost and confused as we didn't spend enough time on the fundamentals.\r\n\r\nI stopped going to his lectures about a month into the semester and decided to watch Professor Van Horn's recordings instead - while he could be monotonous at times, he took much more care with the material, and besides, there are a great number of very helpful TAs both in in-person and online office hours, so I got by that way.\r\n\r\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend taking CMSC330 with Cliff unless you can absorb lots of material very quickly.

People were saying he only has good reviews because he was co-teaching with Justin, but Cliff made his own slides for CMSC250 last semester and taught his own way, so I do feel he's being slandered a bit. Maybe it was because he was the main one to manage CMSC250 and Justin was the main one to manage it last semester, and if that's what people meant, then I suppose so. I felt he did great overall, but maybe this semester is different. I can't speak on that because I didn't take CMSC250 with him this semester, so my opinion may not be as valid as the others, although I feel the other reviews may be a bit over-exaggerated. \r\n\r\nIn terms of CMSC330 though, he was pretty solid too. Not as much as 250 for me last semester, but he was still pretty good. He's very understanding as well. He doesn't question anything, as once I showed him what a TA said on a regrade request on my exam and fixed it on the spot, and he has a lot of sympathy for students. Sometimes he does get thrown off on a slide and gets confused or something, and sometimes he does blatantly read off the slides so going to lecture may not be optimal (he had lecture quizzes online so some people didn't really go to lecture, including me to be honest). The slides posted online helped me navigate through CMSC330 and helped build an understanding for each unit/topic we covered, along with understanding the whole purpose of the course. Sure, it may not be hard to post slides or he might have recycled them, but at the end of the day all the professor has to do is deliver information and make sure you understand it, and I felt like he accomplished that. The exams, quizzes, lecture quizzes, and projects of course were all online and open-note/internet as well, making it less stressful for students too.\r\n\r\nOverall, it was hard for me to pay attention in lecture at times, but that's just me.

Sometimes Cliff's lectures felt like \"I can just look at the slides when he posts them\", but then that turns into \"I have to look at 15 slides the day before an exam\" which i found myself doing a decent bit lol. I didn't give him a 5 star because his lectures are somewhat dull because he's monotone, and that makes it harder to pay attention, especially when you're already lost on some topic.

Unclear deadlines and typos in assignments, quizzes, and slides were extremely commonplace when taking this course. Even what material we were going to cover over the condensed course was questioned a lot by the instructors and TAs. At one point, they even outright lied (probably not intentionally) about what was going to be covered/not covered on the final exam. All of this had a direct impact on the class, and this run of CMSC330 had some of the lowest exam averages on record (the class was curved substantially to make up for this). Apparently, this was due to Cliff somehow not being told that the course was going to only be 6 weeks long instead of 12 weeks long, but I digress.\r\n\r\nAs a lecturer, Cliff was not the worst. He typed things out in Vim to demonstrate concepts, but he went fast and it was largely hit or miss if this approach beat out just sticking to dense slides. For instance, typing out code in Vim made sense, but once we got to NFAs/DFAs and grammars... Why not use whiteboarding software instead? One plus is that he'd post \"Lecture Recap\" videos for each lecture for those who couldn't make it to class. Although, these videos would often be posted 3-5 days after the lecture they covered, so relying on them to keep up is ill advised.\r\n\r\nWhile I didn't personally go to in person office hours (both in person and online OH were offered), those who did described the TAs as \"rude\" and \"bothered by questions.\" This doesn't affect my evaluation of Cliff himself, but I felt that it was worth mentioning and pointing out that this is unacceptable behavior for TAs.\r\n\r\nOverall, I would still recommend taking courses with Cliff over many alternatives simply due to his approachable nature as well as his modern online approach to teaching.

And he's smart. But there have already been so many unclear things this semester, leaving a lot of the class frustrated.\r\n\r\nThe first quiz was rough. The median score was 11.5/20. The reason for this is largely the fact that we had only 20 minutes for two write-in coding portions, plus other fill-in-the-bubble questions, a few of which were annoying trick questions.\r\n\r\nProject 2 was worse. The description was imprecise, and I had to turn to Piazza to understand what exactly he wanted, which nobody should have to do. Not to mention the fact that it was far too difficult for a project that was primarily intended to test your knowledge of regular expressions. I had to give up after spending my entire Friday night & whole day Saturday on it, while still failing two semi-publics. I've never had to do that in the past (granted, I had Larry Herman for my past two project based classes, who is probably way TOO descriptive). The most difficult part of the project also had nothing to do with any new content, and everything to do with (a) understanding what the heck we're even supposed to be writing, and (b) basically recursion stuff, which we all know how to do, but which was further complicated by various things Cliff had done to intentionally make the project more difficult.\r\n\r\nThere have been several other things. One is that, up until maybe the day before the first quiz, the syllabus had said that quizzes were open-note. And they weren't. Next, navigating his slides are like navigating fields of landmines. The slides have like three layers to them, and you can go up, down, left, or right. Which is further complicated by the fact that the slides appear to have a mind of their own, and they'll shift to random places when hitting the left or right arrows, when all you want to do is go back or forward one slide.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Cliff's saving grace is the fact that he, and his large army of TAs, respond fairly quickly to Piazza posts. And he has notes online that have basically all the content, which is a plus. He is not a terrible lecturer at all, and he knows his stuff, which can't be said of everyone.

Usually hits you with a couple really ambiguous multiple choice or true/false but he double majored in philosophy so he likes things abstract and theoretical.

No grading on style-- just tests, and usually these are all public or a mix of public and semipublic. Secret tests were on a couple projects but not most.

Both of these factors make projects much more of a pain than they need to be, as development problems are more often something poorly/not addressed in the README rather than programming logic errors, and \"semipublic\" testing is delayed until the autograder is up.  In addition, while ultimately minor, the lectures were honestly fairly boring and disorganized, as many of them are freeform coding/drawing sessions, but the coding particularly doesn't work because much of the time is spent on coding instead of getting across the main points.  Finally, 20 minutes for the quizzes just feels too short, and 25/30 minutes seems far more reasonable for the assessments they are.\r\n\r\nFor the good, besides the project 8 fiasco, the TAs, Cliff, and Kauffman were all fairly active in responding to Piazza inquiries.  Most of the projects themselves, except for the infamous project 2, have all boiled down to reasonable implementations.  The lecture quizzes were fairly useful, and the amount of forgiveness on them was really nice (I missed one by accident and still got full credit for lecture quizzes).  Exam weighting made exams not overly stressful, and the exams themselves were incredibly fair, which was nice after taking some past exams with fairly memorization-heavy questions (like coding an OCaml parser from memory).  Finally, Cliff and the TA's seem to know when things were screwed up, such as with quiz 1 and project 2, which is reassuring.\r\n\r\nOverall, you will likely do well with Cliff.  Exam averages were around 85 across the board, and nothing seemed too unreasonable at the end of the day (well, almost).  I think he's middle of the road right now, but chances are with a bit of fine tuning, he'll turn out to be a great professor.  Hopefully things get sorted out, as I understand the course is going through some growing pains right now.  At the end of the day, I would still recommend Cliff.  That is, if you had the choice, as CS class registration is in a terrible place right now.\r\n\r\nOne more thing, I didn't really like Rust as the final language of 330.  It kind of just boiled down into a mess of language rules, and the rust projects were not as effective as the OCaml projects in getting us acquainted to the language imo.  The original plan was to tack on Racket, and honestly, I would have much rather had that instead of Rust, as I feel it ties into the themes of the course much better.  It also has the side effect (get it) of preparing us better for 430.", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-12-20T00:05:30.880621Z"}, {"professor": "Cliff Bakalian", "course": "CMSC330", "review": "Very nice guy.
