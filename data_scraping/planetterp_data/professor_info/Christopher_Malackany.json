I took this class online and felt it was very easy. The class assignments are very easy, most of them involved watching a video and answering two questions. One question would be specific and the other would simply be what did you like most. The tests were very straight forward with a mix of multiple choice and true/false. On test days you are given the entire day to start the test so you can pick a time that works best for you to take it. There were also quizzes that were easy. You have 3 days to take a quiz so there is a lot of flexibility, but once you start a quiz you only have 5 minutes to take it. All lecture slides are posted before the lecture.

However, it became tedious listening through zoom for his online class. His quizzes were the most tricky component of his class. The limited time and true/false questions that did not pertain to his slides were definitely challenging. Most terms and definitions were in the textbook but they didn't help much for the test questions. Surprisingly quizlet material helped more. Was a so-so class, had an abundance of information and did not retain much. I would recommend choosing another course for the gen-ed or elective.", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-01-02T23:31:43.515755Z"}, {"professor": "Christopher Malackany", "course": null, "review": "such a boring lecturer", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-04-19T14:27:13.451160Z"}, {"professor": "Christopher Malackany", "course": "SOCY100", "review": "For an intro level sociology class, this class sucked.

Class was highly organized with fully online exams, weekly reading quizzes, short writing assignments (based on external readings or documentaries), and short participation assignments.  All of the media and real-world examples were pretty outdated but still applied to the concepts.  Lecture was always recorded and slides were always uploaded prior to class.  His lecture style is pretty boring especially since the connections weren\u2019t current and he didn\u2019t get through a lot of slides in class.  \r\n\r\nBe prepared for an odd textbook. The textbook had a section where the author blamed public school teachers/administration for why American students' performances are suffering and not the fact that schools rely on test scores for funding.  The textbook also had a section complaining about how school shootings aren\u2019t that big of a problem and cited data that was cut off in 2014 (right before shooting rates spiked).  \r\n\r\nOverall the class was easy and a great way to get your gen ed, I was just confused as to how an interesting subject like sociology was made so lackluster/boring.  If you\u2019re actually interested in sociology I\u2019d take a different professor.", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "A-", "created": "2023-12-07T15:12:01.231176Z"}, {"professor": "Christopher Malackany", "course": "SOCY100", "review": "I liked this class a lot, Professor Malackany is very kind and passionate about what he teaches. I found his lectures to be interesting. The course load was very manageable, and you can miss most lectures without penalty (although sometimes there are 5-point participation assignments.) Each class he goes through slides that are already posted on Canvas, which only covers some of the content you will be tested on. I didn't realize how important reading each chapter of the textbook was until the first exam, so I would say read/skim each unit as you go through the content in class. \r\n\r\nEach unit also comes with an online 5-minute 5-question quiz that you have 3 days to complete. All of the exams are 50 MCQ online, including the final exam which is not cumulative. In addition to this, there are multiple writing assignments based on either critical thinking or documentaries assigned to watch outside of class. The TA grades them on content, not completion.\r\n\r\nFive or six lectures were switched to Zoom, which made it a little harder for me to focus on the content, but I really enjoyed the in-person lectures and did well in the class.
