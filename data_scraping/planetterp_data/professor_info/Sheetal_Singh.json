The grades seem to be just numbers picked out of a hat and assigned to the students. Professor Singh doesn\u2019t provide any relevant or timely feedback with her scores and her communication with course material is provided too late (or is just too confusing/wrong on the Canvas site). The class consisted of students teaching themselves the content before every class, submitting homework, doing a light discussion of what we thought our answers should be during class, then spending the rest of class hearing about her work experience. I would not recommend the class or her as a professor. She didn\u2019t really seem to care all that much considering the course content was taken from the other professor that was also teaching the class, but with a different section.
