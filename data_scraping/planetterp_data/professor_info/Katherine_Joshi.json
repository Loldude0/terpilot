I had her for ENGL 101, and I know that I didn't put much effort to write the papers than other students because I really didn't have much time (this is not an excuse, you will know if you are double majoring in a STEM field), but I tried my best to not fall behind. So, my grade for every paper that I wrote is between B- to B+.  All I am saying is that if you are a STEM major and if you are taking more than 16 credits, I do not recommend taking her class.

I will mention despite rating her like this, she is no monster. She seems like a relatively decent person, her grading standards are just insane. Joshi takes this class, which most students have clearly only taken for the sake of getting their gen ed class for English, and treats it as some kind of upper level english class that is meant for English Majors.

For example why should you write 3 paragraph responses to her bi weekly discussion boards, and spend countless hours on papers that any other English 101 teacher would have given a 98 for, while Joshi- being the strict grader that she is - gives it a 70.
