For example, for quiz 6, despite the fact that the nodal analysis matrix equation is derived from KCL, you get a 0 for the quiz if you derive it from KCL.  I'm not a big fan of that.  For our final exam, he put it very bluntly (and with quite a disappointed tone) that no one got the extra credit, and that exam performance was... very likely worse than usual to say the least.\r\n\r\nFor some other things I didn't really care for in the class, the part of his lectures where he reads off slides are dull.  He doesn't really add much to them except in the rare case he uses a slide as a springboard for a solved example.  Quite frankly I didn't go to a lot of lectures towards the middle, due to a combination of an unreasonably long sickness, the 9:30 start time, and the fact I didn't really get much from them.  I mostly learned through the material through the TA James, who was the GOAT.  Also, homeworks can be quite annoying, and the solutions he provides to TA's don't really help them help us during office hours.  Finally, most things about the labs are awful, from the equipment malfunctions which are difficult to diagnose, to the boring lab procedures which get especially bad regarding the several frequency sweeps performed in the filter labs, to the tedious lab reports themselves.  I believe this is a universal 205 and 245 problem, so I won't hold this against Lawson specifically.\r\n\r\nThat's about it.  Lawson is a good professor for 205.  The use of 8 quizzes across the semester instead of midterms is really nice in reducing stress around what's typically midterm season for other classes (and one of them is dropped according to the syllabus).  The worked examples in class are pretty good.  There's typically a bit of looseness regarding student-professor interaction, with plenty of comedic moments to speak of in the class.  I don't know what else to say.  I can see why people wouldn't like Lawson, but in spite of my issues, I can't say I'm one of the haters for his teaching of 205.", "rating": 4, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-12-17T03:46:13.624635Z"}, {"professor": "Wesley Lawson", "course": "ENEE200", "review": "I'm currently taking this class in Winter 2024, and I'm really not enjoying it.  I tried to adjust my rating for personal bias, but I just cannot compromise my final verdict based on many unfavorable factors.  From what I've heard, Lawson is about the best you're gonna get from ENEE200, so take what you will from this review.\r\n\r\nFirst on the list of personal biases, the class is 3 hours a day for 3 weeks.  ELMS lists 2 hours of lecture and 2 hours of discussion, but in reality it's 3 hours of Lawson's lecture per day, with a 15 minute break somewhere in between.  I have grown increasingly impatient to lectures over the course of college, and even with taking ENES197 last winter, this class is somehow even more of a slog.  Admittedly, there are some pretty interesting stories shared, and the class can get pretty interesting to engage with regarding certain topic discussions.  However, this is not enough to make the class not unbearably dull for me most of the time.  Furthermore, Lawson makes us have our cameras on unless there's a valid excuse, and he states that he retains the right to take off attendance credit for having cameras off.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of, the grading.  If you've had Lawson before, like I did for 205 this past semester, grading will be pretty familiar.  The grade is split into 5 equally weighted parts: participation, homework and a paper, quizzes, final exam, and group project.  One quiz and two homeworks are dropped, and the quizzes and final are theoretically closed book closed notes.  I have issues with three of those components.  Starting with participation, it's not really clear what constitutes a good or bad participation score.  I got a 9/10 for participation 2, and an 8.5/10 for participation 3, both of which are below the mean, and I have no idea why.  I think he mentioned vaguely mentioned some form of criteria on the first day, but there's no rubric, so I can't tell if it's because of internet issues potentially causing my camera to not display sometimes (it always displays on my screen), or if it's because I really struggle to pay attention in class, or what it is.  Regarding the quizzes, they're a mixed bag.  Quizzes 1, 2, and 5 are fairly straight-forward multiple choice affairs, where 5 questions are worth 20% of the quiz each.  3 attempts are given.  Quiz 3 is an open response on line drawing.  Quiz 4 is an open response on conflicts of interest.  Some issues.  I fundamentally disagree with the use of assessments in this course.  They made sense in 205, since each quiz had a corresponding homework.  While some quizzes did go beyond the homework content, we could generally gauge our progress on a quiz's topic from the corresponding homework's feedback.  That is not the case in this class.  I found the homeworks did not correspond well to either quiz 1 or 2, and nothing at all correlated to quiz 3.  Quiz 3 in particular went poorly, as the class average was pretty low (for transparency, I got lower than the mean), but we only got 2 examples of how to do a line drawing (one incomplete example from the slides, and one pretty bad example in lecture).  Yeah the quiz was probably pretty easy, but it's just testing on something where you either memorize a chart or you don't, and it seemed like there was no in-between.  Speaking of, for quiz 4, which I haven't taken yet, we have to memorize specific facts about one of the case studies, and regurgitate conflict of interest information about it.  I don't know how this will turn out, but this accomplishes absolutely nothing.  In fact, none of these quizzes do, and neither will the final exam.  Why are there examinations in an ethics class?  Sure, there are incorrect ways of analyzing a situation.  However, the mere presence of highly weighted examinations imply that there are objectively correct ways of analyzing situations, which is simply not true in any situation with any sort of complexity.  It boils down ethics into algorithms or correct/incorrect answers, which I believe is poor design.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the day-to-day work, there is homework due almost every day, and some of it can get pretty tedious.  However, it's not the worst thing to keep up with, and that's coming me who can't write to save my life outside of the last minute.  Some days are worse than others, but if I had to put a total, it's about an additional hour each day, give or take.  I haven't started my personal paper or group project yet, so that number could probably increase to 2 additional hours per day if you pace yourself well, but I'll probably have to take 3 or more per day this upcoming week since I'm rather behind on those assignments.  It's a winter course I guess.\r\n\r\nI really wanted to like this class.  I gave Lawson 4 stars for 205, and that was in spite of hating the labs.  However, this class is just tedious, and I disagree with his grading methods for this class on a fundamental level.  I realize that I'm writing this review before the end, but I'm at the point where I know this professor and I know this class well enough to know that I thoroughly hated this class.  I've unfortunately had multiple worse classes in the ECE department, but this was certainly not a highlight.  However, this is just my experience.  You may like this class because you like the way Lawson does things, the way he runs things clicks better with you, or simply because he sometimes has interesting stories to tell, and some of the classes have had interesting moments.  You may hate the class more than I do for different reasons than what I brought up.
