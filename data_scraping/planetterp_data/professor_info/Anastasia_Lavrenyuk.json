Class requires a lot of open group discussions and participation. She does take attendance and creates a participation assignment at the end of the semester, so it's best to show up. I missed 2 classes but still got full credit, probably because I participated a lot in discussions, so I advise being engaged. There are weekly 400-word essays for the chapters that we go over, but it truly is not hard. You'll get an A as long as you reach the word limit and turn it in. We had discussion boards the first 3 or 4 weeks of class but then she stopped them, I'm not sure why. There are 2 major group projects (one presentation and one essay, the essay you can choose to do alone). Our final was a 3-4 page essay. There are no exams or quizzes. A very stress-relieving class.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-12-21T00:26:09.139992Z"}], "name": "Anastasia Lavrenyuk", "slug": "lavrenyuk"}
