Dr. Cote was not only extremely accommodating when it came to adjusting submission dates for work, but she also provided excellent feedback on writing assignments. Additionally, despite providing extensive feedback and improvements on minor issues, these minor issues wouldn't reduce your grade heavily, ensuring that you will do well in this class as long as you submit everything on time and follow the requirements. There was one group project that was relatively annoying, and it sucked that we didn't do a personal statement assignment, but as far as improving my writing, I definitely feel that I did that upon completion of this course. I definitely would recommend Dr. Cote for ENGL395.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2023-12-27T23:17:46.906278Z"}], "name": "Rachel Cote", "slug": "cote_rachel"}
