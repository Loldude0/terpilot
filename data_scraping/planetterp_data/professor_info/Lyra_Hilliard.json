Every Tuesday, it was in person; every other Thursday was on Zoom or asynchronous. Lyra was very understanding and kind. The assignments were super easy. All assignments were pass or fail except the Position Paper and Remediation Project. To get full credit on the pass or fail assignments, you need to follow the directions on the prompts. She is very lenient with extensions as long as you ask at least 24 hours before it is due. There were a lot of assignments per week which was annoying but it was expected considering the class was only in person once a week. I would 100% recommend taking the course with her, she made it so easy, and there is no reason you shouldn't get an A as long as you do the work.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-05-18T00:32:13.240167Z"}], "name": "Lyra Hilliard", "slug": "hilliard"}
