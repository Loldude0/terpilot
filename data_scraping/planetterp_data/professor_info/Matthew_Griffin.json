Plus, the practice problems and the practice exams he posts on elms/canvas for exams are exactly what is on the exam.  Often he uses the same exact questions and just changes the values of the given numbers.  \r\n\r\nHe is strict about attendance and expectations, but reasonably so and if you show up to class you have nothing to worry about.

I talked to him during his office hours and he gave me a reasonable extension despite it going against his policy.  \r\n\r\nI did not get an A in class only because I didn't do the Acrobatiq (the online textbook) quizzes and towards the end I didn't hand in the R assignments - don't make the same mistakes.  You get three attempts for the quizzes (in Acrobatiq and elms/canvas) and the best score is taken.  The code is given to you for the R assignments, all you have to do is change certain details (because the code you are given is an example using different data and varibales) - but you are given instructions that tell you exactly how to do so.

What I found most annoying is that he would often stop in the middle of class to tell the students who are talking to stop talking, which is a good thing usually; but when it's done almost every lecture and sometimes for multiple minutes, it takes away from time that we could be using for the actual lecture. He either summarises what's on the lecture slides or reads off of them and usually doesn't expand on them that much since there isn't much to expand on. Almost everything that was on the lecture slides were already learned from the book, so lectures can get really boring since they seem repetitive, but this style somewhat effective since it's basically a review. Aside from that, he does provide a lot of examples about concepts, extra credit opportunities, and practice problems during class.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the course: It's extremely easy if you attend all lectures and do all the readings. The lectures are basically a review of the readings and a chance for practicing the material. There are 2 midterms and a cumulative final. Formula sheets are provided for you, and they're closed-everything (no notes, no books, etc.). The midterms are designed to take up 30 minutes because we usually start a couple minutes into class. There are assignments that are graded from the online interactive textbook. Everything from the book except for the quizzes were graded on completion. There is quite a bit of coding. Almost every discussion is another R coding assignment, which are called \"problem sets\". Most of them could be done in class if you have a background in coding, even the slightest bit. The assignments are provided with tutorials that walk you through the coding. You have to know the concepts from lecture before knowing how to alter the code in order to complete the problem set. Your section's TA use the discussion period to walk you through the tutorial as a class, explain what you need to do in the problem set itself, and then leave the rest of the discussion to work on the problem set and ask for help if you need it.

Attendance is mandatory for everything so go because that helps with your grade and extra credit points are offered in almost every class. Midterm 1 is easy if you attend lectures and study sessions but midterm 2 is a bit more challenging but not impossible. The same thing, attend lectures, discussions, and study sessions and you can guarantee yourself a good grade because the practice exams are the same as the real exam. There are online and paper class activities so attend lectures otherwise you bring your grade down for no reason. Problem sets are almost every week and you learn how to use R. I struggled with this because I am not a STEM major but after a few, you can understand it a bit more as long as you follow along in the discussion. All the TA's and AMPs are really good and super nice and there was a few times I had to leave early from class and they still let me complete the class activities, just tell them in as much advance notice as possible. Professor Griffin is also really flexible if he knows you, so I cannot stress this enough, go to office hours even if it's just to introduce yourself or ask a simple question. If you show you care, he shows he does as well.

I highly recommend going to office hours, even if you don't think you need it, because it allows him to put a face to a name and he's more likely to call on you in class for extra credit.
