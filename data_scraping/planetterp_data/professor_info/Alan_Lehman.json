I have Lehman for CCJS 300 as well and he is not much better. If you're taking 300 go with Brooks. The only reason I took it with Lehman is because I did not want Friday classes. But now for 352; DO NOT take this class with Lehman. The average grade for the first test was a C given that there are only 3 test, including the final, this made obtaining a good grade very difficult. 352 is an elective course and he treats it like a course in chemistry and biology. His test are 100 questions multiple choice and are written in the most complicated way possible.\n\r\nI got screwed over by taking 352 with Lehman to which I was recommended by a friend.

He can be a bit on the boring side some days, but considering the material he's teaching he does a good job of it not being boring EVERY day.\n\r\nFor the SPSS assignments, he writes on the packet he hands you EXACTLY where to click in the program, what kinds of graphs he wants, and how to interpret the data to get your answers. If you come to class, he even gives you the answers to some of the fill in the blank parts. \n\r\nThe exams are a bit tricky, as they're a random mash up of his lectures and stuff in the book. If you go to class and take notes on your laptop and then skim the chapters though before the exam you'll be fine.\n\r\nHe does talk about his work to decriminalize weed a LOT, but it's mostly done when it relates to the material. He also throws extra credit questions on the exam that you will only know the answers to if you go to class.
