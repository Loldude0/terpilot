If you want information about the course syllabus, you can just search up \"cmsc426 prg\" and you should see the Perception and Robotics Group which has links to all of the syllabi from when this course was taught.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- The lectures were helpful for doing well on the midterm, and marginally helpful for the projects. I went to most of the lectures, and I would say they were better for getting a conceptual idea about certain topics. He also writes stuff on the board (equations, diagrams, derivations) that are not in the slides so I would suggest going because just reading the slides alone is pretty confusing. They did help me in some of the projects, and going to them likely boosted my score on the midterm. The professor also did some review before the midterm which was pretty helpful. The lectures also became very close-knit after a few weeks since most people didn't bother coming to them, so if you had questions it was pretty easy to ask.\r\n- The projects were at least about interesting topics in computer vision. The last project even involved using a machine learning model for a practical application, so I think they were probably the most interesting and helpful part of the course. Also, we had 8 late days total to use for the first 3 projects, so that we could get full credit even if we used a few late days.\r\n- Grading was lenient in my opinion (The professor says he \"doesn't believe in grades\"). The median grades for all projects besides the last one were all 100%, producing some output and writing a good report was good enough to get a good score. The midterm exam was a little difficult (median 80%). Also, we had a \"participation\" grade where all you had to do was say something in the Piazza at least 15 or so times, which literally everyone got full credit for. The final project had a median of 75%, that was definitely one that they graded more harshly, since your grade depended on the performance of your model. I heard the final exam was tough, but I can't speak to it since I decided to do the project instead. The overall average course grade was an A- according to the TAs. This semester, 90% was an A, 76% was a B, and 66% was a C+.\r\n- The professor is pretty nice and friendly. He is also very involved in computer vision and robotics research at UMD if that's something you are interested in.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- I said the lectures were helpful, but they definitely could have been much better. The professor had a habit of skipping over some details and that could sometimes make things hard to understand. You also better remember your linear algebra or else you won't be able to follow this class. The lectures also barely covered anything about the projects, he NEVER went over any actual code, so you had to figure out how to implement the things he's saying in Python on your own.\r\n- The TAs completely ran as far as projects, exams, and grading go. We had a piazza that the professor probably was not even a part of, the TAs were responsible for responding to questions there. Sometimes they only provided clarification for projects ON THE DAY THEY WERE DUE, which was very stressful. Sometimes they would even provide conflicting information. I would highly suggest starting these projects early especially if you don't know what you are doing. Otherwise, you will struggle.\r\n- We did not have great preparation for the midterm besides the lectures and all of their slides. At the very least, the slides, our notes, and the projects were decent material to study. The TAs provided a practice midterm, which would have been helpful had they also given us the answer key. They couldn't properly answer the questions in office hours either, rendering that practice midterm basically useless. There was no practice final, however the professor covered some questions in class that he indicated would be on the final.\r\n- Grading took an extremely long time and was not organized at all. We were split onto groups in ELMS, and somehow the TAs were always confused on who was in it what group. Project 1 was due in late September but I'm pretty sure we only got our grades in early December for that one. I'm pretty sure some people didn't even get project 3 grades by the time they submitted grades to Testudo. The midterm exam was multiple choice, because according to the TAs it would be \"faster to grade.\" It still took several weeks to grade and when we got that back, there were numerous grading errors and confusions. I'm almost positive the TAs didn't have an answer key when grading that test. After all of the regrading, my score went up by 17%.\r\n- This course barely scratches the surface of computer vision. He introduces some research in computer vision, but we are barely given any understanding of it as it is very brief in the lecture. \r\n\r\nOverall, this Professor was decent for this subject but the way he ran this class had several flaws.
