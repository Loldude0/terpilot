It's a lot of reading, but everything is discussed in class as a group so if you attend class regularly (attendance is graded with a few excused absences) you will understand what's going on. there are short essays and a final essay, but the short essays are based on what's discussed in class and there is an option to have a 40 minute conversation with her for the final. If she still offers that option, TAKE IT!! She is a fair grader for essays and if you attend class you will do well. The final conversation was extremely laid-back, and was a much better option than writing an entire essay! If you're someone who can commit to going to class and isn't stressed by talking to professors, it's a really good class to take for education and non-education majors.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-11-06T18:32:24.299171Z"}], "name": "Stephanie Chou", "slug": "chou_stephanie"}
