She's a fantastic professor, and makes English interesting. She has high expectations, but is still fun and understanding. The papers you write are about stuff you care about, and about 5 response papers on some readings. One kinda bad thing is that she doesn't hand back papers in a timely fashion, and I have only one grade currently on ELMS, so I'm not exactly sure what my grade is.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "B?", "created": "2012-05-05T00:21:00Z"}, {"professor": "Caroline Wilkins", "course": "ENGL398A", "review": "She's a good professor in terms of knowing a lot about the arts. She's well versed and it definitely shows. She can be a bit snarky and even offensive at times. I really only took the class because I needed it. Unless you are really involved in the arts, I wouldn't take the class. A lot of the work relates to the art you produce. She also doesn't put in grades for major assignments until the last minute, so I don't really know what grade I'm going to get. I don't think I would take a class with her again.", "rating": 3, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-12-05T14:52:08.516767Z"}, {"professor": "Caroline Wilkins", "course": "ENGL398A", "review": "Kind of a harsh grader, very loud and lively even early in the morning.

She is willing to work with you and make accommodations and extensions as needed. The assignments and work themselves are not bad at all, and you get to write about things that you are passionate about. There was a lot of peer editing which was helpful. There were 2 great TA's who were very willing to help with any questions we had. We also got to learn about our classmates and their connection to the arts throughout the semester which was really cool!\r\n\r\nNegatives: Professor Wilkins talks a lot during class, which does not give us much time to participate (and participation grade is very much enforced). She also often makes a lot of inappropriate and just unnecessary comments for our classroom setting, including sharing a lot of personal opinions and talking about students without their knowledge. It just didn't seem very kind and I was worried that at some point in the semester I would become a talking point just for sending in an email. However, my absolute biggest complaint is that I received no grades at all for any of the major assignments until the end of finals week. The end of finals week! This is really unacceptable and I'm not sure if this is even allowed. So if you are someone who wants to know how they are doing in their class throughout the semester, this is not the professor for you. I was very diligent with the work I put into this class, never missed a class except for being sick, and never turned in an assignment late. So I'm just a little disappointed that I'm only now finding out I didn't do as well on some of the major assignments as I thought. With 2 TA's in the class, it's really not good that we didn't get any major assignment grades (besides participation and some hw's) until the last minute. If we don't get feedback throughout the semester on our writing, how are we supposed to learn how to be \"professional writers?\" The class would have been perfect if it weren't for these 2 things and I really wish it could have been different.\r\n\r\nOverall, if you're involved in the arts, this is an awesome and enjoyable professional writing class to take, provided you are okay with the negatives I mentioned above.", "rating": 2, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-12-19T23:43:54.511678Z"}], "name": "Caroline Wilkins", "slug": "wilkins"}
