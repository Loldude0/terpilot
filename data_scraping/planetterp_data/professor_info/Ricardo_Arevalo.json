Dr. Arevalo is a good lecture and does a good job of engaging students in discussion throughout the lecture. Most students would participate in the lecture at some point each class. There were weekly quizzes which felt like they lagged a bit behind where we were in lectures so it was sometimes difficult to predict what to study. Exams could be pretty difficult but there are three, and the last one is take-home AND he drops one of the exams.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "", "created": "2022-12-24T00:56:44.128350Z"}, {"professor": "Ricardo Arevalo", "course": "HNUH228W", "review": "He is a very harsh grader.", "rating": 1, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2024-03-26T18:18:45.090757Z"}], "name": "Ricardo Arevalo", "slug": "arevalo"}
