He is one of the best professors that I have had at UMD. He is so passionate about astronomy and makes lectures really interesting and fun. I love going into his office hours to get extra help and to talk about random space things. He has made me love space so much that I am adding an astronomy minor!\n\r\nIt is definitely one of the more difficult non science major labs because the labs and homework can be sort of tough and the tests are very challenging. The average on all of our tests have been D's. With that being said it is not impossible to get an A on a test as long as you study a lot and care about what you are learning.  He also curves the tests a lot so that the average is a C/B. He gives an extra credit point or two at 95% of the lectures which helps a lot. \n\r\nGreat guy, great class, don't take it if you want to easily get an A, take it if space interests you and you want to learn a lot about it.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A+", "created": "2015-12-01T23:12:00Z"}, {"professor": "Douglas Hamilton", "course": "ASTR450", "review": "ASTRONOMY - Doug Hamilton\r\n------------------------\n\r\nPretty good lecturer.

I got an A- in both ASTR380 and ASTR340 and a B- in ASTR350. These classes were structured in a way that the professors understood that the students in this class take it as an elective, so that's how much they expect from you. However, they are 3xx level classes so their is still a good amount of studying and work to do in order to well. In addition, for these three classes all the hw, quizzes. and exams only relied on class sides, no textbook. These professors also dropped lowest HWs and even Quiz grades.\r\n\r\n ASTR330 on the other hand was something else. The professor required you to read and memorize line by line every single word and concept from the textbook he makes you buy. His class slides were not helpful nor meaningful at all as they only contain a title heading and one picture per slide. He mainly just talks about everything in class and expects you to memorize everything that he has said. The hws are also long and very confusing. His chapter quizzes are also very horribly designed as they can be anything from the dense chapter you have to read and memorize. I barely passed the class, I would not recommend taking this class with this professor if you are thinking that you can easily pass, you need to really work hard for this class as if this was one of your major classes.

The class focuses around a textbook you are forced to read as all the class' content will be drawn from there. The class slides are an attempt to give you more context, however, this consisted of an image and like 2 words lol. The reason he does this is to convince more people to come to class to hear his lecture and what he says during the slides. There are quizzes for each chapter to which the questions can range from \"oh i heard that in lecture\" to \"u have to memorize every detail of the chapter to get this one\". Sometimes there will be online quizzes - which are open note. The homeworks were extremely difficult and graded strictly. I would come into office hours for help and professor Hamilton would spout a lot of random stuff but if you come prepared with questions and an honest attempt, he will offer more help. Treat homeworks seriously as overall they will be weighed more to the final. There were 2 exams and a final, all of which honestly required a lot of memorization. He allows you to have a cheat sheet but that just gives him incentive to make it harder. If you score higher than the average you are in a really good spot, but easier said than done. But I scored below average on the first exam(by a lot) and the final(by quite a bit) and still got a B- b/c I did good on the hws, did pretty good on the quizzes, and scored above avg for the 2nd exam\r\nThere is an automatic curve after every assignment, which is nice but he curves around a C range based on the average(so the average score becomes the C). There is also extra credit provided and a lot of points for participation, which helps for the loss of points from homeworks and exams- so come to class and office hours. Overall, one hell of a class and a lot more work than I would have anticipated. You will need to put a lot of work and time into this class if you want a good grade... and have really good memorization skills.

I really enjoyed his personality, but the silliness became belittling. Especially so as a woman. Another review mentioned how he doesn't understand much outside of a binary sense, making the class hard for neuro-divergent students.

Any chance there has been class feedback opportunities, there have been no changes to improve instruction, exam formatting, and teaching to better assist students in succeeding. There have been a few times when the professor outright humiliated his class by displaying the statistics on class scores, later placing all blame on our efforts and lack of attendance rather than shortcomings that have been voiced on his end. This created a hostile environment and relationship professor to student where few in the class felt psychologically safe to ask for further help. When a class average for an exam is a 58, this says more about the failure of an educator than each individual in the classroom.

The average for the exams in the course were low and he made it seem like he would curve them by assigning a letter grade (For example I got a 74.5 on Exam 1 and I got my exam returned with a B+ on it). However, this was very misleading as at the end of the semester he said the letter grades were not a curve but instead to \"let you know how you're doing in comparison to the rest of the class\". Further, he used collective punishment in class. He got upset that many people weren't attending lectures so he said he would not post lecture recordings and slides until class attendance was over 60%, which was completely unfair to people who attended class regularly and had no control over the attendance of other people. This also hurt people's ability to review for exams which is probably why the grades were so low.
