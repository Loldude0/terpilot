After a few weeks, this became one of my favorite classes. This professor studied literature, and you can tell he is passionate about it. Every class is formatted with some form of media that we discuss as a class, and he really tries to get the class thinking critically and outside the box. The class delves into deep rooted issues and topics that you wouldn't think would be the focus of the class at first glance, but it makes sense and it makes for an extremely interesting class. Attendance is semi mandatory, but he will make it so that you want to attend anyways. This professor clearly cares for his students learning, and for their well being. Many professors have not cared about my personal struggles at all, and Juan has made sure that I am doing ok and accommodated, even at times when I didn't need it or didn't ask.", "rating": 5, "expected_grade": "A", "created": "2023-11-10T09:56:59.948946Z"}, {"professor": "Juan Diaz", "course": "LACS234", "review": "Juan is awesome!
