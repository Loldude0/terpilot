{"course_name": "Living the Good Life: The Psychology of Happiness", "course_number": "PSYC234", "credits": "3", "grading_method": "Reg, P-F, Aud,", "description": "What are the secrets to living a happy life? Can happiness be found within the context of war, a depressed economy, violence and other major stressors? Are some people born happier than others? This course will teach you the scientific process that psychologists use to study happiness (and related emotional variables) and give you the opportunity to practice applying that process in a number of ways. You will learn how we (a) gather and critically evaluate research findings in the existing literature, (b) integrate those findings into coherent and testable theories, (c) design and conduct valid scientific research that tests those theories and extends our knowledge, and (d) effectively communicate our theories and findings to a wide range of audiences. The result of the process is a more accurate and objective understanding of happiness, and that is what prepares you to apply your scientific understanding to explain and influence a wide range of outcomes.", "geneds": ["SCIS", "DSHS"], "sections": [{"section_id": "0101", "professor": "Abigail Nicolas", "total_seats": "40", "open_seats": "9", "waitlist": "0", "times": "MW 3:30pm-4:45pm"}, {"section_id": "0201", "professor": "Carole Sebenick", "total_seats": "23", "open_seats": "0", "waitlist": "0", "times": "TuTh 9:30am-10:45am"}, {"section_id": "FC01", "professor": "Heather Ganginis DelPino", "total_seats": "34", "open_seats": "17", "waitlist": "0", "times": "TuTh 3:00pm-4:15pm"}]}
