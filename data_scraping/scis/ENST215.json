{"course_name": "Bats in Society: Human-Wildlife Relationships, Conflicts, & Solutions", "course_number": "ENST215", "credits": "3", "grading_method": "Reg, P-F, Aud,", "description": "How might an understanding of human-wildlife conflicts shape our approach to disease, ecology, and conservation? Should we care that we are losing wildlife, like bats? Across the globe, human societies have significantly harmed bat populations both intentionally and unintentionally. This course will delve into different bat population crisis causes as well as current and potential solutions, while addressing complex human-wildlife conflicts that need to be considered while solving them. During the course, students will get hands-on experience using highly sophisticated bat acoustic technology to identify bats to species-level. Lecture and discussion sections will focus on bat ecology, management techniques, newest bat identification techniques, data interpretation, and scientific presentation skills.", "geneds": ["SCIS", "DSNS"], "sections": [{"section_id": "0101", "professor": "Shannon Browne", "total_seats": "9", "open_seats": "9", "waitlist": "0", "times": "TuTh 11:00am-12:15pm"}]}
