Has it ever crossed your mind how lucky you are that you live on a water-rich planet with an oxygen-rich atmosphere? Have you ever suspected novelists and scriptwriters of creating ridiculous planets that violate scientific laws? Does the fate of our planet's thin biosphere keep you up at night? How common is life in the Universe? These are difficult questions, but armed with the right information, you can answer all of them. The Science and Fiction of Planetary Systems will help you develop a deeper understanding of why planets are the way they are. Along the way, you'll see examples of mistakes made in classic science fiction movies, novels and short stories and get the chance to invent your own plausible planets!",

Such categorizations are inextricably linked to racism, including a history of misuse in science going back hundreds of years, yet modern biological research and medicine often include the use of race. At its core, addressing this question requires understanding the balance between genetic and non-genetic factors underlying human diversity. The course will help students make an informed critique of the biological basis of race through the study of topics such as: basic biology, data analysis and experimental design, human evolution and genetics, and biomedical research and health outcomes.",

During the course, students will get hands-on experience using highly sophisticated bat acoustic technology to identify bats to species-level.
