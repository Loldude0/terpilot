{"course_name": "Drawn to D.C.: Mapping the City", "course_number": "HNUH259P", "credits": "3", "grading_method": "Reg,", "restriction": "Must have matriculated in University Honors starting in Fall 2020 or later", "description": "Spaces, materials, objects, structures--the building-blocks of cities--index the values of the societies that produce them. By their very nature cities are memory devices. Yet, in an increasingly transient and virtual world, with access to a seemingly infinite amount of memory, what is the status of the spaces we inhabit? This course will explore the relationship among memory, the body and the built environment. Beginning with the role cities play in our individual lives and the construction of personal memories, we will take account of what we forget by remembering and what experiences are missing. Through lectures, seminars and discussions, students will produce short experimental books and pamphlets remapping Washington D.C. and the many invisible - personal - cities it contains. No previous art or design experience required. This course is self-contained but paired with HNUH259T in the Drawn to D.C. track, which explores the created spaces we inhabit, and how they inhabit us.", "geneds": ["DSSP"], "sections": [{"section_id": "0101", "professor": "Instructor: TBA", "total_seats": "20", "open_seats": "19", "waitlist": "0", "times": "MW 11:00am-12:15pm"}]}
