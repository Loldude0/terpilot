Students will gain an understanding of CBRN Weapons, through the exploration of the scientific method, and certain fundamental principles of chemistry, biology, and physics. Students will also learn how to test hypotheses, use basic statistics, interpret results, and apply their new knowledge through discussions of practical applications in the domains of public health, emergency management, epidemiology, and threat assessment. Bringing these fields together in one class will allow students to better understand the use of and threat from CBRN weapons in terrorism.", "geneds": ["DSNS", "DSNL                                    (if taken with BSST241)"], "sections": [{"section_id": "FC01", "professor": "Steve Sin", "total_seats": "18", "open_seats": "11", "waitlist": "0", "times": "TuTh 4:30pm-5:45pm"}]}
